		<h3>Who cares?</h3>
		<p>Proverbially - if anyone wants to fact-check this for me they can - Biden running in 2020 was asked by a conservative journalist, looking for a gotcha: "How many genders are there?" and replied with "at least three."</p>
		<p>As a slightly annoyed response to a slightly memey question, whose main goal was probably to move on without ceding any ground to the hostile journalist or upsetting any of his younger supporters, this is pretty funny.</p>
		<p>But I think it's also as good an answer as any. When historians talk about "gender," they're less concerned with body parts than social expectations, and social expectations differ (duh) by society. Different societies have grouped people up differently, and in particular, pretty much every society has a division we can call "gender" - that is, a set of categories that includes "male" and "female" and sometimes some other categories, like the Navajo <em>nádleehi</em> or Albanian <em>burrnesha</em>. It's as useless to argue over which of these are real as to argue over which alphabet is real.</p>
		<p>And not only can the categories change over time - for instance, it's in your lifetimes that Americans started recognizing "nonbinary" as a category - but also of course the expectations of what a man is, what tasks he has to do and what virtues he has to embody, and so on. For instance, in many parts of the 1700s and 1800s America, it was considered degrading for a man to work for wages - a role not much better than a slave, letting someone else boss you around! Nobler to starve! By the 1900s it was established that a man was a failure if he <em>wasn't</em> working for wages.</p>
		<p>Gender includes superficial rules like "men but not women are expected to wear neckties to white-collar work" or "women but not men can paint their nails" (both of these are weakening currently.) But like the economy and like foreign policy and like civil rights, gender is historically interesting because it's about power. We'll see that expectations of women and men are often pretty sensitive to who has <em>leverage</em> - the ability to set terms in a relationship because they can say "if not, I'll walk, and then you'll be worse off." Relationships between employers and employees work the same way. You don't have to actually start dictating terms for leverage to be useful - often if you're in a situation with little leverage people will start taking advantage of you because they can get away with it, and when you get a little leverage, they start being way more polite. This isn't even the result of conscious cruelty - just people taking the easiest path at any given moment. And these power differences can get enshrined into custom and other little behaviors that reinforce subordination. (Think of how I call you by your first names and you call me by my last name - that's a pretty typical expression of power and hierarchy.)</p>
		<p>Over the last century there's been a huge change in terms of a weakening of patriarchy - that is, men's leverage advantage over women has gotten weaker. Part of this is due to activism, part of this is due to technology, and part of it is due to many small choices made by individuals that added up over time.</p>
		<p>In the reading below you'll read one particular instance of how leverage intersects with the gender division of labor, in one particular household.</p>

		<h3>Reading</h3>
		<p>The following is from Kristin Ghodsee's <em>Why Women Had Better Sex Under Socialism</em>, a book about the relationship between gender and economics. Here the author shares a personal anecdote contrasting her experiences with those of a female friend who doesn't work outside the home.
		<blockquote>
			<p>When I was in my twenties, a dear friend of mine, whom I will call Lisa, worked in human resources for a large corporation in San Francisco... Over the years, we kept in touch, commiserating over marriage and new motherhood. But whereas I started my life as a working mom on the <span title="i.e., in one's early years as a professor, in which one has to get a certain number of findings published to be hired permanently">tenure track</span>, Lisa quit her job to become a stay-at-home mom as soon as she realized she was pregnant. Her husband earned enough to support her, and he preferred that she not be employed. His own mother had stayed home, and among their immediate friends, neighbors, and peers, this was the normal arrangement. Lisa claimed this was her choice; she wanted a break from the rat race of corporate America. She had a second child soon after the first and abandoned the idea of returning to the workforce. Lisa thought it was easier this way; she would be physically there for her daughters in a way that I never could be for mine.</p>
			<p>In those early years, while she baked cookies and organized playdates, I dropped my daughter off at a full-time day care center, five days a week, costing me a small fortune. While her girls napped, Lisa read novels, worked out, and cooked lavish meals. My first four years of motherhood coincided with my first three years on the tenure track. My life was a crushing routine of harried days. The first time I taught class with my shirt inside out, I cringed with embarrassment when a sympathetic student pointed to my seams. But after the third time, I stopped caring. As long as my skirt wasn’t on backwards, it was fine. I often envied Lisa’s choice, but I’d earned my PhD and landed a good job. I didn’t want to quit. Once my daughter turned five, things got a bit easier. My first book came out, I earned tenure, and my daughter started first grade. Out from under the crippling day care bills, I started to reap the psychological and financial rewards of my perseverance.</p>
			<p>A few years later, I spent a weekend with Lisa. Her husband offered to stay in with our three girls so she and I could head to the mall: dinner, a movie, and maybe a little shopping. Our social engagements usually included our children, so this was a real treat. I longed for a few hours of adult conversation with an old friend and no urgent demands for juice or ice cream or unexpected tantrums. A real girls’ night out.</p>
			<p>I’d been upstairs at her house getting ready when I realized I’d forgotten my hair dryer. I wanted to ask Lisa if I could borrow hers, but as I started down the steps, I heard Lisa fighting with her husband.</p>
			<p>“… Please, Bill. It’ll be embarrassing.”</p>
			<p>“No. You’ve spent enough money this month. I’ll give you the card again after the statement rolls.”</p>
			<p>“But I shopped for the house and bought clothes for the girls. I didn’t buy anything for me.”</p>
			<p>“You’re always buying things for yourself and saying it’s for the girls.”</p>
			<p>“But it is for the girls. They keep growing.”</p>
			<p>“You have enough clothes. You don’t need anything else. I’ve given you enough for the dinner and the movie.”</p>
			<p>“Bill, please.” Lisa’s voice cracked.</p>
			<p>I turned to tiptoe back up the stairs, praying they hadn’t heard me. I hid in the bathroom until Lisa came up, jaw clenched and eyes pink.</p>
			<p>We drove to the restaurant in silence. We ordered two courses, and I attempted to prolong the dinner until just before the film started. Lisa seemed grateful to linger.</p>
			<p>After our second glass of Malbec she said, “Bill and I had a fight.”</p>
			<p>I looked down at my plate.</p>
			<p>“He says we don’t have sex often enough.”</p>
			<p>I looked up. That’s not the fight I thought I heard.</p>
			<p>She swirled her empty glass. “You think we have time for another one?”</p>
			<p>“You go ahead,” I said. “I’ll drive.”</p>
			<p>She drank a third glass of wine, and we chatted about the reviews of the film we planned to see. When the check came, she opened her wallet and pushed some twenty-dollar bills across the table at me. I put down my credit card.</p>
			<p>She looked at the American Express with my name on it, and sighed. “Bill only gives me cash.”</p>
			<p>“Why don’t you let me get this?” I slid the money back at her. “Keep it.”</p>
			<p>She stared down at the table for a long moment. Finally, she said, “Thanks,” and scooped the bills back into her wallet. “I’ll [have sex with] him tonight and pay you back tomorrow.”</p>
			<p>I sat there, stunned.</p>
			<p>Lisa looked at her watch. “If we hurry, I can hit the Shiseido counter before the movie starts.”</p>
			<p>Sitting in the restaurant that night, I swore to myself that no matter how hard it was to balance my full-time job with care for my daughter, I would never put myself in Lisa’s position if I had any choice in the matter.</p>

		<h3>Why am I learning about this in an <em>American</em> history class?</h3>
		<p>For context!</p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3>An important way in which nature <em>does</em> matter</h3>
		<p>Here's a pretty depressing chart - or maybe a pretty optimistic chart, if you put the focus on what we've managed to accomplish:</p>
		<img src="https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/Youth-mortality-rates-over-last-two-millennia-2_850.png">A chart of childhood mortality, running around half until relatively recently</img>
		<p>Let's set aside the massive tragedy, and just think about the math - how many kids does each woman need to have just to keep population constant? Four. So if a new mother spends 15 months nursing - she spends more than that in most traditional societies - that's a minimum of 8 years of life, on average, she spends pregnant or nursing.</p>
		<p>In fact, when the categories are divided up, "women" in most societies means "the people we're presuming are going to be pregnant or nursing for most of the prime of their lives." Anything else women do generally has to be compatible with this. There's nothing biological that requires childcare of older children to be part of the mix, but doing so <em>is</em> compatible with these requirements, and sif women are taking on that responsibility, their other work has to be compatible with that, too. Food preparation and weaving are the two biggest tasks that are compatible with this.</p>
		<p>So in most societies before the industrial revolution, women's work involves raising children, weaving, and preparing food. (The modern sense of "cooking" might capture this for forager women, but not for those in grain-based agricultural civilizations, where most of the work would have been slowly grinding grains.) This is more than enough work to fill up the entire day.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3>Foraging societies</h3>
		<p>By "foraging," I mean "hunter-gatherer." Most of the human timeline is us having this kind of economy, and most of it is pretty equal, both generally and in terms of the relationship between genders.</p>
		<p>This surprises many people who've been trained to expect a model of "primitive" humans are ruled, like other great apes, by "alpha males," the biggest and most aggressive men around. That isn't too far off from how some of our closest relatives, like chimpanzees, operate - one guy who can push anybody around because he can take anyone in a fight. But men who act like that in human forager societies tend to get scolded by the community and asked to take themselves down a notch, and those who don't revise it from there can be ganged up on and killed, in their sleep if necessary. Thus, forager societies tend to rarely feature anybody who bosses anyone else around. Further, since land is mostly unguarded - full of food for anybody willing to put in the effort - if someone <em>does</em> start trying to boss you around, you can just leave.</p>
		<p>That said, there's still some significant variation in this. In particular, some foraging societies are relatively more patriarchal - men have higher status than women, and men can boss around their wives. This seems to be most common when societies are <em>patrilocal</em> - where a wife moves to live in her husband's village. (People tend not to marry in the same village because that would lead to inbreeding before too long.) In a village like that, all the men know and are related to each other, but all the women are strangers, so the men will tend to team up and act as one team. This is useful if there's a risk of war - you want all the local young men to fight together, even die for each other, to defend the village - but maybe not so great if your husband beats you when you don't do what he wants (who would you turn to?)</p>
		<p>If patrilocality leads to patriarchal societies, does matrilocality lead to matriarchal societies? Apparently not - maybe men's greater strength protects them here. But it does lead to fairly equal ones. As do other systems. Men and women do different work, but neither husbands nor wives have authority over each other.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3>Herding societies</h3>
		<p>Herding societies tend to be <em>very</em> patriarchal. Why?</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Herds are pretty easy to steal. So for defensive reasons most herding societies are very patrilocal, consisting of men who know how to fight together and will always take each others' side.</li>
			<li>If you can get good at fighting like that, you can start enslaving people who aren't as good at fighting, like farmers. Enslaved women may be taken as enslaved wives, and by then extreme patriarchy is pretty entrenched.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In terms of their later cultural influence, herding societies punch above their weight in one important respect - people from those societies wrote much of the scriptures that Jews, Christians, and Muslims today recognize as holy. (That's why Jesus is "the good shepherd.")</p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3>A dreary selection of primary sources</h3>
		<p>Here's Aristotle, the ancient Greek philosopher who was known as "<em>the</em> philosopher later in Europe, so respected was he.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>A good wife should be the mistress of her home... This, then, is the province over which a woman should be minded to bear an orderly rule; for it seems not fitting that a man should know all that passes within the house. But in all other matters, let it be her aim to obey her husband; giving no heed to public affairs, nor having any part in arranging the marriages of her children.</p>
			<p>Rather, when the time shall come to give or receive in marriage sons or daughters, let her then hearken to her husband in all respects, and agreeing with him obey his wishes. It is fitting that a woman of a well-ordered life should consider that her husband’s wishes are as laws appointed for her by divine will, along with the marriage state and the fortune she shares. If she endures them with patience and gentleness, she will rule her home with ease; otherwise, not so easily.</p>
		</blockquote>
		Is India any better? Here are the <em>Laws of Manu</em>:
		<blockquote>
			<p>Hear now the duties of women.</p>
			<p>By a girl, by a young woman, or even by an aged one, nothing must be done independently, even in her own house.</p>
			<p>In childhood a female must be subject to her father, in youth to her husband, when her lord is dead to her sons; a woman must never be independent.</p>
			<p>She must not seek to separate herself from her father, husband, or sons; by leaving them she would make both (her own and her husband’s) families contemptible.</p>
			<p>She must always be cheerful, clever in (the management of her) household affairs, careful in cleaning her utensils, and economical in expenditure.</p>
			<p>Him to whom her father may give her, or her brother with the father’s permission, she shall obey as long as he lives, and when he is dead, she must not insult (his memory). . . .</p>
			<p>Though destitute of virtue, or seeking pleasure (elsewhere), or devoid of good qualities, (yet) a husband must be constantly worshipped as a god by a faithful wife.</p>
			<p>No sacrifice, no vow, no fast must be performed by women apart (from their husbands); if a wife obeys her husband, she will for that (reason alone) be exalted in heaven. . . .</p>
			<p>[S]he must never even mention the name of another man after her husband has died. . . .</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>These laws weren't necessarily enforced - they were seen as societal ideals. But still, the fact that many people saw them as ideals says a lot. Aristotle was a man, and almost certainly so was the author of the <em>Laws of Manu</em>, but many women ended up internalizing - or at least working within - these ideas as well. Here's Ban Zhao, a female historian and writer of the Han dynasty:
		<blockquote>
			<p>The Way of husband and wife is intimately connected with Yin and Yang and relates the individual to gods and ancestors. Truly it is the great principle of Heaven and Earth, and the great basis of human relationships. . . .</p>
			<p>If a husband be unworthy, then he possesses nothing by which to control his wife. If a wife be unworthy, then she possesses nothing with which to serve her husband. If a husband does not control his wife, then the rules of conduct manifesting his authority are abandoned and broken. If a wife does not serve her husband, then the proper relationship between men and women and the natural order of things are neglected and destroyed. As a matter of fact the purpose of these two is the same.</p>
			<p>Now examine the gentlemen of the present age. They only know that wives must be controlled, and that the husband’s rules of conduct manifesting his authority must be established. They therefore teach their boys to read books and study histories. But they do not in the least understand that husbands and masters must also be served, and that the proper relationship and the rites should be maintained. Yet only to teach men and not to teach women — is that not ignoring the essential relation between them? According to the “Rites” [a classic text], it is the rule to begin to teach children to read at the age of eight years, and by the age of fifteen years they ought then to be ready for cultural training. Only why should it not be that girls’ education as well as boys’ be according to this principle?</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Is Ban simply reinforcing these beliefs, or cleverly undermining them by using them to advocate for women's education, or a bit of both? Regardless of how you interpret <em>her</em>, it's clear what at least many people around her took for granted - that wives should be totally subordinate to their husbands.</p>
		<p>Something that all these readings have in common is that they're all talking about upper-class women. This is a weakness of written texts of more than a few centuries ago generally - only the upper classes knew how to read. And indeed patriarchy was probably less strong for peasant women. For instance, consider the practice of <em>sati</em>, in which upper-class Hindu women would burn to death on the funeral pyres of their husbands, or footbinding in Imperial China, which made it difficult for upper-class Chinese women to move around. Either of these practices would, in addition to the pain imposed on an individual, be an extravagant sacrifice for a peasant household to make - making one of their members less able to contribute to household needs. In fact, this wastefulness is probably a large part of why upper-class households continued these practices. If you bind your daughter's feet, then any family would want to marry her to knows that you have the money to afford it, which in turn ironically makes her a more attractive bride (people always want to marry into money, especially in highly <span title="hierarchical, unequal">stratified</span> ones like agricultural societies.</p>

		<h3>Changes with the industrial revolution</h3>
		<p>The industrial revolution is the root cause of almost all the changes to society in the last two centuries, and changes in the relationships between women and men is no exception.</p>
		<p>First, the burden of traditional women's labor decreased drastically:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Childhood mortality fell from about half to nearly nothing, meaning that the number of children the average woman needed to have to keep a stable population fell from four to two</li>
			<li>Increasingly reliable birth control meant that how many children to have was more and more a choice</li>
			<li>Universal education provided babysitting during the school years</li>
			<li>Automation made the grinding of grain and spinning of thread - the other two traditional women's tasks - increasingly efficient and performed in factories</li>
		</ul>
		<p>So the work that was done by 100 women at home - spinning, weaving, taking care of children - might be done by 30 women - ten working as teachers, ten in a food processing plant, and ten in a textile factory. Obviously, this entailed huge shifts in the gender division of labor, as did the similar amounts of suddenly available male labor that had previously been used for farming.</p> 
		<figure>
			<img src="https://www.statista.com/graphic/1/1033027/fertility-rate-us-1800-2020.jpg" alt="a chart showing births per woman in US falling over time">
			<figcaption>A chart showing total fertility rate (births per woman) falling dramatically over time. Note that it's falling from well above what was ever needed for replacement fertility - Americans were especially likelyto have lots of children in the 1800s, given the availability of land seized from Native peoples.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>The effects of the industrial revolution and rise of capitalism on the gendered division of labor impacted working-class and middle-class couples differently. Working-class women, as you might guess, frequently worked outside the home, in textile factories or as servants. For middle-class men, having a wife who didn't work was a sign of having "made it" - it showed the man was successful enough that the family only required his income. This would be true throughout the middle of the 1900s, where middle-class women start joining professional roles in large numbers.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3>Changes for men</h3>
		<p>Sometimes gender history is equated with women's history - partially because most history is traditionally concerned with men (or at least elite men.) But it's worth noting that understandings of masculinity were changing in this period as well.</p>
		<p>In the United States, prior to the rise of capitalism, the presumed goal for a free man was to become an independent farmer. Men were regarded as being full adults once they had acquired what was called a <em>competency</em> - enough land for a man to work himself and support a wife and children. To work for someone else for money was regarded as similar to slavery and emasculating. "Hirelings," unlike independent farmers, could not decide how to order their days or decide when to wake up or begin work, and they had to accept orders from others. For white American men, both their sense of masculinity and their understanding of the achievements of the American Revolution meant that they would never have to accept orders from another - each full man stood independently.</p>
		<p>Over time, as the ability to function as a small family farm declined and people became more dependent on the factory jobs that emerged, American masculinity changed to accomodate their new situation. A new model emerged whereby a man was not emasculated by working for money, but instead his earning a wage was a way of providing for a family, like the earlier competency had been. Under this new understanding, it was the man who refused to work for wages, or couldn't get hired, that was the failure.</p>

		<p>First-wave feminism in the United States had two essential legal victories: the end of coverture and the passing of universal suffrage.</p>
		<p>"Coverture" refers to a legal doctrine that women's right to sign contracts and own property only comes through their husbands or fathers. Under this system, which was present in most Western countries (including the US) before the modern era, women were made completely dependent on men: any given husband might "generously" allow his wife to act as if she were an independent person with her own rights, that could be taken away at any time. These were abolished at the state level (states being the main enforcers of property law) in a series of Married Women's Property Acts across the 1800s.</p>
		
		<p>After coverture was abolished, the focus shifted to the right to vote. Universal adult suffrage also appeared first on the state level, before becoming national in 1920. This was similar to most other countries, which adopted universal adult suffrage shortly after WW1 (which ended in 1918.)</p>

		<p>The first wave has traditionally been criticized for being concerned only with a small number of elite white women. There's some truth to this, but it forgets the strong connections between the <span title="supporting the outlawing of slavery">abolitionist</span> and first-wave feminist movements (Stanton, below, was an abolitionist, and Parsons, below, had actually been born into slavery), and in the presence of a working-class women's movement connected to the labor movement. The fights against coverture and for women's suffrage, although they were not the final word, significantly expanded the ability of women to participate in public life, laying the foundation for later successes.</p>

		<h3>Readings: Liberal and socialist feminisms</h3>
		<p>Another reason the industrial revolution led to a decline in the strength of patriarchy is new ideologies. The ideolgies of the agricultural era had emphasized the world as one big hierarchy: for instance, in the Abrahamic religions, God was understood a benevolent father-king ruling over the whole world, and had authority on loan to kings and priests, who endorsed the rule of fathers over wives and children. Liberalism, which emerged in the 1600s, and socialism, which emerged in the 1800s, disagreed over many things (mainly the organization of the economy), but they both believed in the ideas of the Enlightenment: that people were basically equal and could work progressively to make the world better and better. These ideas, alongside the overthrow of traditional knowledge by science, made an all-out attack on traditional authority inevitable, including the traditional authority weilded by men over women.</p>
		<p>The following is from Elizabeth Cady Stanton's 1892 speech <em>the Solitude of the Self</em>, and emphasizes traditional liberal themes:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The point I wish plainly to bring before you on this occasion is the individuality of each human soul; <span title="many Americans at the time regarded the country as Protestant by nature, and connected that to individual freedom">our Protestant idea</span>, the right of individual conscience and judgment; <span title="here she means representative government generally, not just a particular political party">our republican idea</span>, individual citizenship. In discussing the rights of woman, we are to consider, first, what belongs to her as an individual, in a world of her own, the arbiter of her own destiny, <span title="referring to a popular novel in which a shipwrecked sailor makes a life for himself on an island">an imaginary Robinson Crusoe, with her woman, Friday, on a solitary island</span>. Her rights under such circumstances are to use all her faculties for her own safety and happiness.</p>
			<p>Secondly, if we consider her as a citizen, as a member of a great nation, she must have the same rights as all others members, according to the fundamental principles of our Government.</p>
			<p>Thirdly, viewed as a woman, an equal factor in civilization, her rights and duties are still the same— individual happiness and development.</p>
			<p>Fourthly, it is only the incidental relations of life, such as mother, wife, sister, daughter, which may involve some special duties and training. . . .</p>
			<p>The strongest reason for giving woman all the opportunities for higher education, for the full development of her faculties, her forces of mind and body; for giving her the most enlarged freedom of thought and action; a complete emancipation from all forms of bondage, of custom, dependence, superstition; from all the crippling influences of fear—is the solitude and personal responsibility of her own individual life. The strongest reason why we ask for woman a voice in the government under which she lives; in the religion she is asked to believe; equality in social life, where she is the chief factor; a place in the trades and professions, where she may earn her bread, is because of her birthright to self-sovereignty; because, as an individual, she must rely on herself. No matter how much women prefer to lean, to be protected and supported, nor how much men desire to have them do so, they must make the voyage of life alone, and for safety in an emergency, they must know something of the laws of navigation. To guide our own craft, we must be captain, pilot, engineer; with chart and compass to stand at the wheel; to watch the winds and waves, and know when to take in the sail, and to read the <span title="constellations">signs in the firmament</span> over all. It matters not whether the solitary voyager is man or woman; nature, having <span title="made them equal">endowed them equally</span>, leaves them to their own skill and judgment in the hour of danger, and, if not equal to the occasion, alike they <span title="die">perish</span>.</p>
			<p>To appreciate the importance of fitting every human soul for independent action, think for a moment of the immeasurable solitude of self. We come into the world alone, unlike all who have gone before us, we leave it alone, under circumstances peculiar to ourselves. No mortal ever has been, no mortal ever will be like the soul just launched on the sea of life. There can never again be just such a combination of prenatal influences; never again just such environments as make up the infancy, youth and manhood of this one. Nature never repeats herself, and the possibilities of one human soul will never be found in another. No one has ever found two blades of ribbon grass alike, and no one will ever find two human beings alike. Seeing, then, what must be the infinite diversity in human character, we can in a measure appreciate the loss to a nation when any class of the people is uneducated and unrepresented in the government.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>So the message is: "if you want the liberal program of individual advancement, women must be part of this program too." Lucy Parsons, an anarchist and socialist, made essentially a parallel appeal in a speech to the Industrial Workers of the World:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>I wish to state to you that I have taken the floor because no other woman has responded, and I feel that it would not be out of place for me to say in my poor way a few words about this movement. We, the women of this country, have no ballot even if we wished to use it, and the only way that we can be represented is to take a man to represent us. You men have made such a mess of it in representing us that we have not much confidence in asking you; and I for one feel very backward in asking the men to represent me. We have no ballot, but we have our labor. I think it is August Bebel, in his <em>Woman in the Past, Present and Future</em> — a book that should be read by every woman that works for wages — Bebel says that men have been slaves throughout all the ages, but that woman’s condition has been worse, for she has been the slave of a slave.</p>
			<p>There was never a greater truth uttered. We are the slaves of the slaves. We are exploited more ruthlessly than men. Wherever wages are to be reduced the capitalist class use women to reduce them, and if there is anything that you men should do in the future it is to organize the women. And I say that if the women had inaugurated a boycott of the State Street stores since the teamsters’ strike, the stores would have surrendered long ago. I do not stand before you to brag. I had no man connected with that strike to make it of interest to me to boycott the stores, but I have not bought one penny’s worth there since that strike was inaugurated. I intended to boycott all of them as one individual at least, so it is important to educate the women.</p>
			<p>Now, I wish to show my sisters here that we fasten the chains of slavery upon our sisters, sometimes unwittingly, when we go down to the department store and look around so cheap. When we come to reflect it simply means the robbery of our sisters, for we know that the things cannot be made for such prices and give women who made them fair wages.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>That is, "if you want the socialist program of economic equality and people having control over their own labor, women must be a part of this too."</p>
		<p>The selection of these speeches emphasizes the role that women had in advocating for their rights. Indeed, many male liberals and socialists argued for equality (of various kinds) among men without considering the consequences for gender relations. But it's also true that a number of male leaders of these movements - such as liberals like the Marquis de Condorcet or John Stuart Mill, or socialists like Friedrich Engels and August Bebel (referenced by Parsons above) - argued well before it was popular that women and men should have equal rights. </p>
