	<p>This is your reading for the next few days. (Since this is an experiment, I haven't filled it out with everything for this unit, but if the first day or two are a success, I will.) Go through the flashcards as you go. If you sign up inside the flashcard window, you can get automated review when you come back of the ones that were trickiest for you, but you don't need to sign up; you can just reload the page and go through them again. Text with a little bit of underline like this has an aside, sometimes providing definitions in the case of <span title="big, fancy words">sesquipedalian vocabulary</span> or other nonobvious references, especially in primary texts.</p>

		<h3>Who cares?</h3>
		<p>Proverbially - if anyone wants to fact-check this for me they can - Biden running in 2020 was asked by a conservative journalist, looking for a gotcha: "How many genders are there?" and replied with "at least three."</p>
		<p>As a slightly annoyed response to a slightly memey question, whose main goal was probably to move on without ceding any ground to the hostile journalist or upsetting any of his younger supporters, this is pretty funny.</p>
		<p>But I think it's also as good an answer as any. When historians talk about "gender," they're less concerned with body parts than social expectations, and social expectations differ (duh) by society. Different societies have grouped people up differently, and in particular, pretty much every society has a division we can call "gender" - that is, a set of categories that includes "male" and "female" and sometimes some other categories, like the Navajo <em>nádleehi</em> or Albanian <em>burrnesha</em>. It's as useless to argue over which of these are real as to argue over which alphabet is real.</p>
		<p>And not only can the categories change over time - for instance, it's in your lifetimes that Americans started recognizing "nonbinary" as a category - but also of course the expectations of what a man is, what tasks he has to do and what virtues he has to embody, and so on. For instance, in many parts of the 1700s and 1800s America, it was considered degrading for a man to work for wages - a role not much better than a slave, letting someone else boss you around! Nobler to starve! By the 1900s it was established that a man was a failure if he <em>wasn't</em> working for wages.</p>
		<p>Gender includes superficial rules like "men but not women are expected to wear neckties to white-collar work" or "women but not men can paint their nails" (both of these are weakening currently.) But like the economy and like foreign policy and like civil rights, gender is historically interesting because it's about power. We'll see that expectations of women and men are often pretty sensitive to who has <em>leverage</em> - the ability to set terms in a relationship because they can say "if not, I'll walk, and then you'll be worse off." Relationships between employers and employees work the same way. You don't have to actually start dictating terms for leverage to be useful - often if you're in a situation with little leverage people will start taking advantage of you because they can get away with it, and when you get a little leverage, they start being way more polite. This isn't even the result of conscious cruelty - just people taking the easiest path at any given moment. And these power differences can get enshrined into custom and other little behaviors that reinforce subordination. (Think of how I call you by your first names and you call me by my last name - that's a pretty typical expression of power and hierarchy.)</p>
		<p>In the reading below you'll read one particular instance of how leverage intersects with the gender division of labor, in one particular household.</p>

		<h3>Reading</h3>
		<p>The following is from Kristin Ghodsee's <em>Why Women Had Better Sex Under Socialism</em>, a book about the relationship between gender and economics. Here the author shares a personal anecdote contrasting her experiences with those of a female friend who doesn't work outside the home.
		<blockquote>
			<p>When I was in my twenties, a dear friend of mine, whom I will call Lisa, worked in human resources for a large corporation in San Francisco... Over the years, we kept in touch, commiserating over marriage and new motherhood. But whereas I started my life as a working mom on the <span title="i.e., in one's early years as a professor, in which one has to get a certain number of findings published to be hired permanently">tenure track</span>, Lisa quit her job to become a stay-at-home mom as soon as she realized she was pregnant. Her husband earned enough to support her, and he preferred that she not be employed. His own mother had stayed home, and among their immediate friends, neighbors, and peers, this was the normal arrangement. Lisa claimed this was her choice; she wanted a break from the rat race of corporate America. She had a second child soon after the first and abandoned the idea of returning to the workforce. Lisa thought it was easier this way; she would be physically there for her daughters in a way that I never could be for mine.</p>
			<p>In those early years, while she baked cookies and organized playdates, I dropped my daughter off at a full-time day care center, five days a week, costing me a small fortune. While her girls napped, Lisa read novels, worked out, and cooked lavish meals. My first four years of motherhood coincided with my first three years on the tenure track. My life was a crushing routine of harried days. The first time I taught class with my shirt inside out, I cringed with embarrassment when a sympathetic student pointed to my seams. But after the third time, I stopped caring. As long as my skirt wasn’t on backwards, it was fine. I often envied Lisa’s choice, but I’d earned my PhD and landed a good job. I didn’t want to quit. Once my daughter turned five, things got a bit easier. My first book came out, I earned tenure, and my daughter started first grade. Out from under the crippling day care bills, I started to reap the psychological and financial rewards of my perseverance.</p>
			<p>A few years later, I spent a weekend with Lisa. Her husband offered to stay in with our three girls so she and I could head to the mall: dinner, a movie, and maybe a little shopping. Our social engagements usually included our children, so this was a real treat. I longed for a few hours of adult conversation with an old friend and no urgent demands for juice or ice cream or unexpected tantrums. A real girls’ night out.</p>
			<p>I’d been upstairs at her house getting ready when I realized I’d forgotten my hair dryer. I wanted to ask Lisa if I could borrow hers, but as I started down the steps, I heard Lisa fighting with her husband.</p>
			<p>“… Please, Bill. It’ll be embarrassing.”</p>
			<p>“No. You’ve spent enough money this month. I’ll give you the card again after the statement rolls.”</p>
			<p>“But I shopped for the house and bought clothes for the girls. I didn’t buy anything for me.”</p>
			<p>“You’re always buying things for yourself and saying it’s for the girls.”</p>
			<p>“But it is for the girls. They keep growing.”</p>
			<p>“You have enough clothes. You don’t need anything else. I’ve given you enough for the dinner and the movie.”</p>
			<p>“Bill, please.” Lisa’s voice cracked.</p>
			<p>I turned to tiptoe back up the stairs, praying they hadn’t heard me. I hid in the bathroom until Lisa came up, jaw clenched and eyes pink.</p>
			<p>We drove to the restaurant in silence. We ordered two courses, and I attempted to prolong the dinner until just before the film started. Lisa seemed grateful to linger.</p>
			<p>After our second glass of Malbec she said, “Bill and I had a fight.”</p>
			<p>I looked down at my plate.</p>
			<p>“He says we don’t have sex often enough.”</p>
			<p>I looked up. That’s not the fight I thought I heard.</p>
			<p>She swirled her empty glass. “You think we have time for another one?”</p>
			<p>“You go ahead,” I said. “I’ll drive.”</p>
			<p>She drank a third glass of wine, and we chatted about the reviews of the film we planned to see. When the check came, she opened her wallet and pushed some twenty-dollar bills across the table at me. I put down my credit card.</p>
			<p>She looked at the American Express with my name on it, and sighed. “Bill only gives me cash.”</p>
			<p>“Why don’t you let me get this?” I slid the money back at her. “Keep it.”</p>
			<p>She stared down at the table for a long moment. Finally, she said, “Thanks,” and scooped the bills back into her wallet. “I’ll [have sex with] him tonight and pay you back tomorrow.”</p>
			<p>I sat there, stunned.</p>
			<p>Lisa looked at her watch. “If we hurry, I can hit the Shiseido counter before the movie starts.”</p>
			<p>Sitting in the restaurant that night, I swore to myself that no matter how hard it was to balance my full-time job with care for my daughter, I would never put myself in Lisa’s position if I had any choice in the matter.</p>

		<h3>Why am I learning about this in an <em>American</em> history class?</h3>
		<p>For context!</p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3>An important way in which nature <em>does</em> matter</h3>
		<p>Here's a pretty depressing chart - or maybe a pretty optimistic chart, if you put the focus on what we've managed to accomplish:</p>
		<img src="https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/Youth-mortality-rates-over-last-two-millennia-2_850.png">A chart of childhood mortality, running around half until relatively recently</img>
		<p>Let's set aside the massive tragedy, and just think about the math - how many kids does each woman need to have just to keep population constant? Four. So if a new mother spends 15 months nursing - she spends more than that in most traditional societies - that's a minimum of 8 years of life, on average, she spends pregnant or nursing.</p>
		<p>In fact, when the categories are divided up, "women" in most societies means "the people we're presuming are going to be pregnant or nursing for most of the prime of their lives." </p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3>Foraging societies</h3>
		<p>By "foraging," I mean "hunter-gatherer." Most of the human timeline is us having this kind of economy, and most of it is pretty equal, both generally and in terms of the relationship between genders.</p>
		<p>This surprises many people who've been trained to expect a model of "primitive" humans are ruled, like other great apes, by "alpha males," the biggest and most aggressive men around. That isn't too far off from how some of our closest relatives, like chimpanzees, operate - one guy who can push anybody around because he can take anyone in a fight. But men who act like that in human forager societies tend to get scolded by the community and asked to take themselves down a notch, and those who don't revise it from there can be ganged up on and killed, in their sleep if necessary. Thus, forager societies tend to rarely feature anybody who bosses anyone else around. Further, since land is mostly unguarded - full of food for anybody willing to put in the effort - if someone <em>does</em> start trying to boss you around, you can just leave.</p>
		<p>That said, there's still some significant variation in this. In particular, some foraging societies are relatively more patriarchal - men have higher status than women, and men can boss around their wives. This seems to be most common when societies are <em>patrilocal</em> - where a wife moves to live in her husband's village. (People tend not to marry in the same village because that would lead to inbreeding before too long.) In a village like that, all the men know and are related to each other, but all the women are strangers, so the men will tend to team up and act as one team. This is useful if there's a risk of war - you want all the local young men to fight together, even die for each other, to defend the village - but maybe not so great if your husband beats you when you don't do what he wants (who would you turn to?)</p>
		<p>If patrilocality leads to patriarchal societies, does matrilocality lead to matriarchal societies? Apparently not - maybe men's greater strength protects them here. But it does lead to fairly equal ones. As do other systems.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3>Herding societies</h3>
		<p>Herding societies tend to be <em>very</em> patriarchal. Why?</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Herds are pretty easy to steal. So for defensive reasons most herding societies are very patrilocal, consisting of men who know how to fight together and will always take each others' side.</li>
			<li>If you can get good at fighting like that, you can start enslaving people who aren't as good at fighting, like farmers. Enslaved women may be taken as enslaved wives, and by then extreme patriarchy is pretty entrenched.</li>
		</ol>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3>A dreary selection of primary sources</h3>
		<p>Here's Aristotle, the ancient Greek philosopher who was known as "<em>the</em> philosopher later in Europe, so respected was he.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>A good wife should be the mistress of her home... This, then, is the province over which a woman should be minded to bear an orderly rule; for it seems not fitting that a man should know all that passes within the house. But in all other matters, let it be her aim to obey her husband; giving no heed to public affairs, nor having any part in arranging the marriages of her children.</p>
			<p>Rather, when the time shall come to give or receive in marriage sons or daughters, let her then hearken to her husband in all respects, and agreeing with him obey his wishes. It is fitting that a woman of a well-ordered life should consider that her husband’s wishes are as laws appointed for her by divine will, along with the marriage state and the fortune she shares. If she endures them with patience and gentleness, she will rule her home with ease; otherwise, not so easily.</p>
		</blockquote>
		Is India any better? Here are the <em>Laws of Manu</em>:
		<blockquote>
			<p>Hear now the duties of women.</p>
			<p>By a girl, by a young woman, or even by an aged one, nothing must be done independently, even in her own house.</p>
			<p>In childhood a female must be subject to her father, in youth to her husband, when her lord is dead to her sons; a woman must never be independent.</p>
			<p>She must not seek to separate herself from her father, husband, or sons; by leaving them she would make both (her own and her husband’s) families contemptible.</p>
			<p>She must always be cheerful, clever in (the management of her) household affairs, careful in cleaning her utensils, and economical in expenditure.</p>
			<p>Him to whom her father may give her, or her brother with the father’s permission, she shall obey as long as he lives, and when he is dead, she must not insult (his memory). . . .</p>
			<p>Though destitute of virtue, or seeking pleasure (elsewhere), or devoid of good qualities, (yet) a husband must be constantly worshipped as a god by a faithful wife.</p>
			<p>No sacrifice, no vow, no fast must be performed by women apart (from their husbands); if a wife obeys her husband, she will for that (reason alone) be exalted in heaven. . . .</p>
			<p>[S]he must never even mention the name of another man after her husband has died. . . .</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>These laws weren't necessarily enforced - they were seen as societal ideals. But still, the fact that many people saw them as ideals says a lot. Aristotle was a man, and almost certainly so was the author of the <em>Laws of Manu</em>, but many women ended up internalizing - or at least working within - these ideas as well. Here's Ban Zhao, a female historian and writer of the Han dynasty:
		<blockquote>
			<p>The Way of husband and wife is intimately connected with Yin and Yang and relates the individual to gods and ancestors. Truly it is the great principle of Heaven and Earth, and the great basis of human relationships. . . .</p>
			<p>If a husband be unworthy, then he possesses nothing by which to control his wife. If a wife be unworthy, then she possesses nothing with which to serve her husband. If a husband does not control his wife, then the rules of conduct manifesting his authority are abandoned and broken. If a wife does not serve her husband, then the proper relationship between men and women and the natural order of things are neglected and destroyed. As a matter of fact the purpose of these two is the same.</p>
			<p>Now examine the gentlemen of the present age. They only know that wives must be controlled, and that the husband’s rules of conduct manifesting his authority must be established. They therefore teach their boys to read books and study histories. But they do not in the least understand that husbands and masters must also be served, and that the proper relationship and the rites should be maintained. Yet only to teach men and not to teach women — is that not ignoring the essential relation between them? According to the “Rites” [a classic text], it is the rule to begin to teach children to read at the age of eight years, and by the age of fifteen years they ought then to be ready for cultural training. Only why should it not be that girls’ education as well as boys’ be according to this principle?</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Is Ban simply reinforcing these beliefs, or cleverly undermining them by using them to advocate for women's education, or a bit of both? Regardless of how you interpret <em>her</em>, it's clear what at least many people around her took for granted - that wives should be totally subordinate to their husbands.</p>
		<p>Something that all these readings have in common is that they're all talking about upper-class women. This is a weakness of written texts of more than a few centuries ago generally - only the upper classes knew how to read. And indeed patriarchy was probably less strong </p>
