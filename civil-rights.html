				<p>After World War II, America faced ongoing issues with racial discrimination, including fights against segregation in schools. Back in 1896, the Supreme Court had ruled that having separate facilities for different races was okay as long as they were equal. But in reality, Black students in the South often had less money spent on their education, went to schools in poor condition, and used low-quality learning materials. African Americans fought against this unfair treatment in education for over fifty years.</p>

				<p>Then, on May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court made a big decision in a case called Brown v. Board of Education. The Chief Justice, Earl Warren, announced that the court unanimously agreed (9-0) that separating students by race was unconstitutional because it went against the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. They said that having separate schools for different races was naturally unfair. This decision made "separate but equal" illegal.</p>

				<p>The victory in the Brown case came after many years of hard work by African Americans, who fought against racial inequality through lawsuits and protests, and the support of liberal judges on the Supreme Court. Starting in the 1930s, the NAACP (a group working for the rights of African Americans) began to attack the laws that allowed segregation in the South. Laws and social norms there were especially tough on Black people. Through many court cases about education, voting rights, and jury service, NAACP lawyers like Charles Hamilton Houston, Robert L. Clark, and Thurgood Marshall, who later became a Supreme Court Justice himself, worked to show that the government was not providing equal opportunities to Black students as promised. By the late 1940s, activists started to argue more strongly against the idea that separation by race was even legal.</p>

		        	<p>Older battles over racial exclusion also confronted postwar American society. One long-simmering struggle targeted segregated schooling. In 1896, the Supreme Court declared the principle of “separate but equal” constitutional. Segregated schooling, however, was rarely “equal”: in practice, Black Americans, particularly in the South, received fewer funds, attended inadequate facilities, and studied with substandard materials. African Americans’ battle against educational inequality stretched across half a century before the Supreme Court again took up the merits of “separate but equal.”</p>
				<p>On May 17, 1954, after two years of argument, re-argument, and deliberation, Chief Justice Earl Warren announced the Supreme Court’s decision on segregated schooling in <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> (1954). The court found by a unanimous 9–0 vote that racial segregation violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court’s decision declared, “Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.” “Separate but equal” was made unconstitutional.<sup><a href="#footnote_13_117" id="identifier_13_117" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Oliver Brown, et al. v. Board of Education of Topeka, et al., 347 U.S. 483 (1954).">14</a></sup></p>
				<p>Decades of African American–led litigation, local agitation against racial inequality, and liberal Supreme Court justices made <em>Brown</em> possible. In the early 1930s, the NAACP began a concerted effort to erode the legal underpinnings of segregation in the American South. Legal, or de jure, segregation subjected racial minorities to discriminatory laws and policies. Law and custom in the South hardened antiblack restrictions. But through a series of carefully chosen and contested court cases concerning education, disfranchisement, and jury selection, NAACP lawyers such as Charles Hamilton Houston, Robert L. Clark, and future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall undermined Jim Crow’s constitutional underpinnings. These attorneys initially sought to demonstrate that states systematically failed to provide African American students “equal” resources and facilities, and thus failed to live up to <em>Plessy</em>. By the late 1940s activists began to more forcefully challenge the assumptions that “separate” was constitutional at all.</p>
