    <div class="text-content default" data-level="level1">
        <p>After World War II, America faced ongoing issues with racial discrimination, including fights against segregation in schools. Back in 1896, the Supreme Court had ruled that having separate facilities for different races was okay as long as they were equal. But in reality, Black students in the South often had less money spent on their education, went to schools in poor condition, and used low-quality learning materials. African Americans fought against this unfair treatment in education for over fifty years.</p>
		<p>Then, on May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court made a big decision in a case called <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>. The Chief Justice, Earl Warren, announced that the court unanimously agreed (9-0) that separating students by race was unconstitutional because it went against the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. They said that having separate schools for different races was naturally unfair. This decision made "separate but equal" illegal.</p>
		<p>The victory in the <em>Brown</em> case came after many years of hard work by African Americans, who fought against racial inequality through lawsuits and protests, and the support of liberal judges on the Supreme Court. Starting in the 1930s, the <abbr title="National Association for the Advancement of Colored People">NAACP</abbr> (a group working for the rights of African Americans) began to attack the laws that allowed segregation in the South. Laws and social norms there were especially tough on Black people. Through many court cases about education, voting rights, and jury service, NAACP lawyers like Charles Hamilton Houston, Robert L. Clark, and Thurgood Marshall, who later became a Supreme Court Justice himself, worked to show that the government was not providing equal opportunities to Black students as promised. By the late 1940s, activists started to argue more strongly against the idea that separation by race was even legal.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-content" data-level="level2">
        <p>Older battles over racial exclusion also confronted postwar American society. One long-simmering struggle targeted segregated schooling. In 1896, in <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em>, the Supreme Court declared the principle of ‚Äúseparate but equal‚Äù constitutional. Segregated schooling, however, was rarely ‚Äúequal‚Äù: in practice, Black Americans, particularly in the South, received fewer funds, attended inadequate facilities, and studied with substandard materials. African Americans‚Äô battle against educational inequality stretched across half a century before the Supreme Court again took up the merits of ‚Äúseparate but equal.‚Äù</p>
		<p>On May 17, 1954, after two years of argument, re-argument, and deliberation, Chief Justice Earl Warren announced the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision on segregated schooling in <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> (1954). The court found by a unanimous 9‚Äì0 vote that racial segregation violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court‚Äôs decision declared, ‚ÄúSeparate educational facilities are inherently unequal.‚Äù ‚ÄúSeparate but equal‚Äù was made unconstitutional.(<span title="Oliver Brown, et al. v. Board of Education of Topeka, et al., 347 U.S. 483 (1954).">x</span>)</p>
		<p>Decades of African American‚Äìled <span title="bringing challenges in the court system">litigation</span>, local agitation against racial inequality, and liberal Supreme Court justices made <em>Brown</em> possible. In the early 1930s, the NAACP began a concerted effort to erode the legal underpinnings of segregation in the American South. Legal, or <em>de jure</em>, segregation subjected racial minorities to discriminatory laws and policies. Law and custom in the South hardened antiblack restrictions. But through a series of carefully chosen and contested court cases concerning education, <span title="being denied the right to vote">disfranchisement</span>, and jury selection, NAACP lawyers such as Charles Hamilton Houston, Robert L. Clark, and future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall undermined Jim Crow‚Äôs constitutional underpinnings. These attorneys initially sought to demonstrate that states systematically failed to provide African American students ‚Äúequal‚Äù resources and facilities, and thus failed to live up to <em>Plessy</em>. By the late 1940s activists began to more forcefully challenge the assumptions that ‚Äúseparate‚Äù was constitutional at all.</p>

    <div class="text-content default" data-level="level1">
        <p>Even though many people think of <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> as just one lawsuit, it actually brought together five different cases from across the southeastern United States. These cases were <em>Briggs v. Elliott</em> from South Carolina, <em>Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County</em> from Virginia, <em>Beulah v. Belton</em> from Delaware, <em>Bolling v. Sharpe</em> from Washington, D.C., and <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> from Kansas. The NAACP, working with local groups fighting against segregation, chose these cases from different areas on purpose. They wanted to show that segregation was a problem not just in the Deep South. They aimed to challenge the basic legality of segregation established by an earlier case, <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em>.</p>
		<p>The first case the NAACP took on, <em>Briggs v. Elliott</em>, highlighted the poor conditions of segregated Black schools in a South Carolina county. In 1950, a lot more money was spent on educating white students compared to Black students. The area's white schools were worth a lot more than the numerous Black schools, which were in bad shape and overcrowded. While Briggs showed how the South wasn't meeting the equal part of "separate but equal," the Brown case focused more on how being segregated by law made Black people feel inferior. The NAACP argued that separation itself was the problem. A witness in the Kansas court said that bringing Black and white children together from a young age was the way to help the Black community achieve equality.</p>
		<p>To support their argument, the NAACP used both history and social science. The Supreme Court wasn't convinced by the historical evidence alone but was influenced by the NAACP's proof that segregation hurt Black children mentally. This proof included experiments by Kenneth and Mamie Clark with dolls, showing that both Black and white children preferred white dolls. This preference suggested that segregation made Black children view themselves negatively.</p>
		<p>However, pointing out that segregation was wrong didn't immediately fix the problem. Although the <em>Brown</em> decision said segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, it didn't address segregation in other areas. Also, to keep the decision unanimous and impactful, the Court didn't specify how to enforce desegregation. Their vague direction in 1955 to desegregate "with all deliberate speed" left the task of integrating schools to those who were against it, making the process very slow and difficult.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-content" data-level="level2">
        <p>Though remembered as just one lawsuit, <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> consolidated five separate cases that had originated in the southeastern United States: <em>Briggs v. Elliott</em> (South Carolina), <em>Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County</em> (Virginia), <em>Beulah v. Belton</em> (Delaware), <em>Bolling v. Sharpe</em> (Washington, D.C.), and <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> (Kansas). Working with local activists already involved in desegregation fights, the NAACP purposely chose cases with a diverse set of local backgrounds to show that segregation was not just an issue in the Deep South, and that a sweeping judgment on the fundamental constitutionality of <em>Plessy</em> was needed.</p>
		<p><em>Briggs v. Elliott</em>, the first case accepted by the NAACP, illustrated the plight of segregated Black schools. <em>Briggs</em> originated in rural Clarendon County, South Carolina, where taxpayers in 1950 spent $179 to educate each white student and $43 for each Black student. The district‚Äôs twelve white schools were cumulatively worth $673,850; the value of its sixty-one Black schools (mostly dilapidated, overcrowded shacks) was $194,575.(<span title="James T. Patterson and William W. Freehling, Brown v. Board of Education: A Civil Rights Milestone and Its Troubled Legacy (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 25; Pete Daniel, Standing at the Crossroads: Southern Life in the Twentieth Century (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996), 161‚Äì164.">x</span>) While <em>Briggs</em> underscored the South‚Äôs failure to follow <em>Plessy</em>, the <em>Brown</em> suit focused less on material disparities between Black and white schools (which were significantly less than in places like Clarendon County) and more on the social and spiritual degradation that accompanied legal segregation. This case cut to the basic question of whether ‚Äúseparate‚Äù was itself inherently unequal. The NAACP said the two notions were incompatible. As one witness before the U.S. District Court of Kansas said, ‚ÄúThe entire colored race is craving light, and the only way to reach the light is to start [black and white] children together in their infancy and they come up together.‚Äù (<span title="Patterson and Freehling, Brown v. Board, xxv.">x</span>)</p>
		<p>To make its case, the NAACP marshaled historical and social scientific evidence. The Court found the historical evidence inconclusive and drew their ruling more heavily from the NAACP‚Äôs argument that segregation psychologically damaged Black children. To make this argument, association lawyers relied on social scientific evidence, such as the famous doll experiments of Kenneth and Mamie Clark. The Clarks demonstrated that while young white girls would naturally choose to play with white dolls, young Black girls would, too. The Clarks argued that Black children‚Äôs aesthetic and moral preference for white dolls demonstrated the pernicious effects and self-loathing produced by segregation.</p>
		<p>Identifying and denouncing injustice, though, is different from rectifying it. Though <em>Brown</em> repudiated <em>Plessy</em>, the Court‚Äôs orders did not extend to segregation in places other than public schools and, even then, to preserve a unanimous decision for such an historically important case, the justices set aside the divisive yet essential question of enforcement. Their infamously ambiguous order in 1955 (what came to be known as <em>Brown II</em>) that school districts desegregate ‚Äúwith all deliberate speed‚Äù was so vague and ineffectual that it left the actual business of desegregation in the hands of those who opposed it.</p>

    <div class="text-content default" data-level="level1">
        <p>In many places in the South and the rest of America, schools didn't really start mixing students of different races until long after the <em>Brown</em> decision. It wasn't until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that the government began to really push for this change. They told school districts that if they didn't start integrating, they might lose money from the government. Even with this threat, some schools in the South still tried to avoid mixing their students. However, court cases like <em>Green v. New Kent County</em> in 1968 and <em>Alexander v. Holmes</em> in 1969 stopped some of these ways schools were trying to keep students separated, like the ‚Äúfreedom of choice‚Äù plans, and started to make real changes in integration.</p>
		<p>Once the <em>Brown</em> decision began to be enforced in the South, things changed a lot. Fourteen years after <em>Brown</em>, in 1968, 80% of Black students in the South went to schools that were almost entirely made up of nonwhite students. But by 1972, only 25% of Black students were in those kinds of schools, and 55% were in schools where nonwhite students were in the minority. Surprisingly, this made the Southern public schools some of the most integrated in the country.</p>
		<p>The <em>Brown</em> decision is a very important part of American history, not so much because of the immediate changes, which were slow and complicated, but because of what it stood for and the movement it started. The highest court in the country challenged a big part of the laws that kept races separated and helped pave the way for one of the biggest social movements in American history.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-content" data-level="level2">
        <p>In most of the South, as well as the rest of the country, school integration did not occur on a wide scale until well after <em>Brown</em>. Only in the 1964 Civil Rights Act did the federal government finally implement some enforcement of the <em>Brown</em> decision by threatening to withhold funding from recalcitrant school districts, but even then southern districts found loopholes. Court decisions such as <em>Green v. New Kent County</em> (1968) and <em>Alexander v. Holmes</em> (1969) finally closed some of those loopholes, such as ‚Äúfreedom of choice‚Äù plans, to compel some measure of actual integration.</p>
		<p>When <em>Brown</em> finally was enforced in the South, the quantitative impact was staggering. In 1968, fourteen years after <em>Brown</em>, some 80 percent of school-age Black southerners remained in schools that were 90 to 100 percent nonwhite. By 1972, though, just 25 percent were in such schools, and 55 percent remained in schools with a simple nonwhite minority. By many measures, the public schools of the South became, ironically, the most integrated in the nation. (<span title="Charles T. Clotfelter, After Brown: The Rise and Retreat of School Desegregation (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2011), 6.">x</span>)
		<p>As a landmark moment in American history, <em>Brown</em>‚Äôs significance perhaps lies less in immediate tangible changes ‚Äî which were slow, partial, and inseparable from a much longer chain of events ‚Äî than in the idealism it expressed and the momentum it created. The nation‚Äôs highest court had attacked one of the fundamental supports of Jim Crow segregation and offered constitutional cover for the creation of one of the greatest social movements in American history.</p>

<h2 id="sec-2">The Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s</h2>

<div class="section">
    <div class="text-content default" data-level="level1">
        <p>Fighting against racism wasn't just about changing schools. African Americans challenged unfair treatment in all parts of life. Before World War II, these efforts didn't see much success. But, the war effort and a campaign called Double V, which stood for victories against fascism overseas and racism at home, along with the economic growth after the war, made many African Americans hope for better treatment. When racism continued to block their chances for a better life, they started fighting harder against unfair laws and beliefs.</p>
		<p>While we often remember the 1960s for big civil rights events like sit-ins and the March on Washington, the 1950s were also crucial. For example, before Rosa Parks's famous bus protest, Sarah Keys, an African American woman in the army, refused to give up her seat on a bus in 1953. This led to a major decision in 1955 that said "separate but equal" on buses went against the U.S. Constitution. Although this rule wasn't always followed, it helped set the stage for later protests.</p>
		<p>However, not all events were inspiring. In 1955, the murder of a young boy named Emmett Till in Mississippi shocked many. Emmett, from Chicago, didn't follow the racist rules of the South and was killed for it. His killers were found not guilty, but later bragged about their crime. This tragedy motivated many young people to join the civil rights movement.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-content" data-level="level2">
        <p>Education was but one aspect of the nation‚Äôs Jim Crow machinery. African Americans had been fighting against a variety of racist policies, cultures, and beliefs in all aspects of American life. And while the struggle for Black inclusion had few victories before World War II, the war and the Double V campaign for victory against fascism abroad and racism at home, as well as the postwar economic boom led, to rising expectations for many African Americans. When persistent racism and racial segregation undercut the promise of economic and social mobility, African Americans began mobilizing on an unprecedented scale against the various discriminatory social and legal structures.</p>
		<p>While many of the civil rights movement‚Äôs most memorable and important moments, such as the sit-ins, the Freedom Rides, and especially the March on Washington, occurred in the 1960s, the 1950s were a significant decade in the sometimes tragic, sometimes triumphant march of civil rights in the United States. In 1953, years before Rosa Parks‚Äôs iconic confrontation on a Montgomery city bus, an African American woman named Sarah Keys publicly challenged segregated public transportation. Keys, then serving in the Women‚Äôs Army Corps, traveled from her army base in New Jersey back to North Carolina to visit her family. When the bus stopped in North Carolina, the driver asked her to give up her seat for a white customer. Her refusal to do so landed her in jail in 1953 and led to a landmark 1955 decision, <em>Sarah Keys v. Carolina Coach Company</em>, in which the Interstate Commerce Commission ruled that ‚Äúseparate but equal‚Äù violated the Interstate Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Poorly enforced, it nevertheless gave legal coverage for the Freedom Riders years later and motivated further assaults against Jim Crow.</p>
		<p>But if some events encouraged civil rights workers with the promise of progress, others were so savage they convinced activists that they could do nothing but resist. In the summer of 1955, two white men in Mississippi kidnapped and brutally murdered fourteen-year-old Emmett Till. Till, visiting from Chicago and perhaps unfamiliar with the ‚Äúetiquette‚Äù of Jim Crow, allegedly whistled at a white woman named Carolyn Bryant. Her husband, Roy Bryant, and another man, J. W. Milam, abducted Till from his relatives‚Äô home, beat him, mutilated him, shot him, and threw his body in the Tallahatchie River. Emmett‚Äôs mother held an open-casket funeral so that Till‚Äôs disfigured body could make national news. The men were brought to trial. The evidence was damning, but an all-white jury found the two not guilty. Mere months after the decision, the two boasted of their crime, in all of its brutal detail, in <em>Look</em> magazine. ‚ÄúThey ain‚Äôt gonna go to school with my kids,‚Äù Milam said. They wanted ‚Äúto make an example of [Till]‚Äîjust so everybody can know how me and my folks stand.‚Äù (<span title="William Bradford Huie, ‚ÄúThe Shocking Story of Approved Killing in Mississippi,‚Äù Look (January 24, 1956), 46‚Äì50.">x</span>) The Till case became an indelible memory for the young Black men and women soon to propel the civil rights movement forward.</p>

        <p>In December 1955, Rosa Parks's refusal to give up her seat led to the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Activists, including Martin Luther King Jr., organized this boycott, which lasted over a year and ended with the Supreme Court ordering buses to be integrated. This victory was a big boost for the civil rights movement.</p>
		<p>Encouraged by Montgomery's success, Martin Luther King Jr. and others founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in 1957 to help organize protests across the South. That same year, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the first such law since Reconstruction. Though it wasn't very strong, it showed that the fight for civil rights was starting to have an impact.</p>
		<p>Despite these wins, the civil rights movement faced strong opposition. People against the movement often used violence to scare and stop African Americans from demanding their rights. For instance, during the Montgomery boycott, some churches and civil rights leaders' homes were bombed. This violence showed the tough challenges the movement still had to overcome.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-content" data-level="level2">
        <p>On December 1, 1955, four months after Till‚Äôs death and six days after the <em>Keys v. Carolina Coach Company</em> decision, Rosa Parks refused to surrender her seat on a Montgomery city bus and was arrested. Montgomery‚Äôs public transportation system had longstanding rules requiring African American passengers to sit in the back of the bus and to give up their seats to white passengers if the buses filled. Parks was not the first to protest the policy by staying seated, but she was the first around whom Montgomery activists rallied.</p>
		<p>Activists sprang into action. Joanne Robinson, who as head of the Women‚Äôs Political Council had long fought against the city‚Äôs segregated busing, worked long into the night to with a colleague and two students from Alabama State College to mimeograph over 50,000 handbills calling for an immediate boycott. Montgomery‚Äôs Black community responded, and, in response, local ministers and civil rights workers formed the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) to coordinate an organized, sustained boycott of the city‚Äôs buses. The Montgomery Bus Boycott lasted from December 1955 until December 20, 1956, when the Supreme Court ordered their integration. The boycott not only crushed segregation in Montgomery‚Äôs public transportation, it energized the entire civil rights movement and established the leadership of the MIA‚Äôs president, a recently arrived, twenty-six-year-old Baptist minister named Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
		<p>Motivated by the success of the Montgomery boycott, King and other Black leaders looked to continue the fight. In 1957, King, fellow ministers such as Ralph Abernathy and Fred Shuttlesworth, and key staffers such as Ella Baker and Septima Clark helped create and run the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to coordinate civil rights groups across the South in their efforts to organize and sustain boycotts, protests, and other assaults against Jim Crow discrimination.</p>
		<p>As pressure built, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the first such measure passed since Reconstruction. The act was compromised away nearly to nothing, although it did achieve some gains, such as creating the Department of Justice‚Äôs Civil Rights Commission, which was charged with investigating claims of racial discrimination. And yet, despite its weakness, the act signaled that pressure was finally mounting on Americans to confront the legacy of discrimination.</p>
		<p>Despite successes at both the local and national level, the civil rights movement faced bitter opposition. Those opposed to the movement often used violent tactics to scare and intimidate African Americans and subvert legal rulings and court orders. For example, a year into the Montgomery bus boycott, angry white southerners bombed four African American churches as well as the homes of King and fellow civil rights leader E. D. Nixon. Though King, Nixon, and the MIA persevered in the face of such violence, it was only a taste of things to come. Such unremitting hostility and violence left the outcome of the burgeoning civil rights movement in doubt. Despite its successes, civil rights activists looked back on the 1950s as a decade of mixed results and incomplete accomplishments. While the bus boycott, Supreme Court rulings, and other civil rights activities signaled progress, church bombings, death threats, and stubborn legislators demonstrated the distance that still needed to be traveled.</p>
