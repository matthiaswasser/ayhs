<h2 id="sec-1"><em>Brown v. Board</em> and educational desegregation</h2>
<!-- Section 1 -->
<div class="section">
    <div class="text-content default" data-level="level1">
        <p>After World War II, America faced ongoing issues with racial discrimination, including fights against <span title="separation">segregation</span> in schools. Back in 1896, the Supreme Court had ruled in <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> that having separate facilities for different races was okay as long as they were equal. But in reality, Black students in the South often had less money spent on their education, went to schools in poor condition, and used low-quality learning materials. African Americans fought against this unfair treatment in education for over fifty years.</p>
		<p>Then, on May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court made a big decision in a case called <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>. The Chief Justice, Earl Warren, announced that the court unanimously agreed (9-0) that separating students by race was unconstitutional because it went against the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. They said that having separate schools for different races was naturally unfair. This decision made "separate but equal" illegal.</p>
		<p>The victory in the <em>Brown</em> case came after many years of hard work by African Americans, who fought against racial inequality through lawsuits and protests, and the support of liberal judges on the Supreme Court. Starting in the 1930s, the <abbr title="National Association for the Advancement of Colored People">NAACP</abbr> (a group working for the rights of African Americans) began to attack the laws that allowed segregation in the South. Laws and social norms there were especially tough on Black people. Through many court cases about education, voting rights, and jury service, NAACP lawyers like Charles Hamilton Houston, Robert L. Clark, and Thurgood Marshall, who later became a Supreme Court Justice himself, worked to show that the government was not providing equal opportunities to Black students as promised. By the late 1940s, activists started to argue more strongly against the idea that separation by race was even legal.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-content" data-level="level2">
        <p>Older battles over racial exclusion also confronted postwar American society. One long-simmering struggle targeted segregated schooling. In 1896, in <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em>, the Supreme Court declared the principle of ‚Äúseparate but equal‚Äù constitutional. Segregated schooling, however, was rarely ‚Äúequal‚Äù: in practice, Black Americans, particularly in the South, received fewer funds, attended inadequate facilities, and studied with substandard materials. African Americans‚Äô battle against educational inequality stretched across half a century before the Supreme Court again took up the merits of ‚Äúseparate but equal.‚Äù</p>
		<p>On May 17, 1954, after two years of argument, re-argument, and deliberation, Chief Justice Earl Warren announced the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision on segregated schooling in <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> (1954). The court found by a unanimous 9‚Äì0 vote that racial segregation violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court‚Äôs decision declared, ‚ÄúSeparate educational facilities are inherently unequal.‚Äù ‚ÄúSeparate but equal‚Äù was made unconstitutional.(<span title="Oliver Brown, et al. v. Board of Education of Topeka, et al., 347 U.S. 483 (1954).">x</span>)</p>
		<p>Decades of African American‚Äìled <span title="bringing challenges in the court system">litigation</span>, local agitation against racial inequality, and liberal Supreme Court justices made <em>Brown</em> possible. In the early 1930s, the <abbr title="National Association for the Advancement of Colored People">NAACP</abbr> began a concerted effort to erode the legal underpinnings of segregation in the American South. Legal, or <em>de jure</em>, segregation subjected racial minorities to discriminatory laws and policies. Law and custom in the South hardened antiblack restrictions. But through a series of carefully chosen and contested court cases concerning education, <span title="being denied the right to vote">disfranchisement</span>, and jury selection, NAACP lawyers such as Charles Hamilton Houston, Robert L. Clark, and future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall undermined Jim Crow‚Äôs constitutional underpinnings. These attorneys initially sought to demonstrate that states systematically failed to provide African American students ‚Äúequal‚Äù resources and facilities, and thus failed to live up to <em>Plessy</em>. By the late 1940s activists began to more forcefully challenge the assumptions that ‚Äúseparate‚Äù was constitutional at all.</p>

<div class="section">
    <div class="text-content default" data-level="level1">
        <p>Even though many people think of <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> as just one lawsuit, it actually brought together five different cases from across the southeastern United States. These cases were <em>Briggs v. Elliott</em> from South Carolina, <em>Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County</em> from Virginia, <em>Beulah v. Belton</em> from Delaware, <em>Bolling v. Sharpe</em> from Washington, D.C., and <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> from Kansas. The NAACP, working with local groups fighting against segregation, chose these cases from different areas on purpose. They wanted to show that segregation was a problem not just in the Deep South. They aimed to challenge the basic legality of segregation established by an earlier case, <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em>.</p>
		<p>The first case the NAACP took on, <em>Briggs v. Elliott</em>, highlighted the poor conditions of segregated Black schools in a South Carolina county. In 1950, a lot more money was spent on educating white students compared to Black students. The area's white schools were worth a lot more than the numerous Black schools, which were in bad shape and overcrowded. While Briggs showed how the South wasn't meeting the equal part of "separate but equal," the Brown case focused more on how being segregated by law made Black people feel inferior. The NAACP argued that separation itself was the problem. A witness in the Kansas court said that bringing Black and white children together from a young age was the way to help the Black community achieve equality.</p>
		<p>To support their argument, the NAACP used both history and social science. The Supreme Court wasn't convinced by the historical evidence alone but was influenced by the NAACP's proof that segregation hurt Black children mentally. This proof included experiments by Kenneth and Mamie Clark with dolls, showing that both Black and white children preferred white dolls. This preference suggested that segregation made Black children view themselves negatively.</p>
		<p>However, pointing out that segregation was wrong didn't immediately fix the problem. Although the <em>Brown</em> decision said segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, it didn't address segregation in other areas. Also, to keep the decision unanimous and impactful, the Court didn't specify how to enforce desegregation. Their vague direction in 1955 to desegregate "with all deliberate speed" left the task of integrating schools to those who were against it, making the process very slow and difficult.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-content" data-level="level2">
        <p>Though remembered as just one lawsuit, <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> consolidated five separate cases that had originated in the southeastern United States: <em>Briggs v. Elliott</em> (South Carolina), <em>Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County</em> (Virginia), <em>Beulah v. Belton</em> (Delaware), <em>Bolling v. Sharpe</em> (Washington, D.C.), and <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> (Kansas). Working with local activists already involved in desegregation fights, the NAACP purposely chose cases with a diverse set of local backgrounds to show that segregation was not just an issue in the Deep South, and that a sweeping judgment on the fundamental constitutionality of <em>Plessy</em> was needed.</p>
		<p><em>Briggs v. Elliott</em>, the first case accepted by the NAACP, illustrated the plight of segregated Black schools. <em>Briggs</em> originated in rural Clarendon County, South Carolina, where taxpayers in 1950 spent $179 to educate each white student and $43 for each Black student. The district‚Äôs twelve white schools were cumulatively worth $673,850; the value of its sixty-one Black schools (mostly dilapidated, overcrowded shacks) was $194,575.(<span title="James T. Patterson and William W. Freehling, Brown v. Board of Education: A Civil Rights Milestone and Its Troubled Legacy (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 25; Pete Daniel, Standing at the Crossroads: Southern Life in the Twentieth Century (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996), 161‚Äì164.">x</span>) While <em>Briggs</em> underscored the South‚Äôs failure to follow <em>Plessy</em>, the <em>Brown</em> suit focused less on material disparities between Black and white schools (which were significantly less than in places like Clarendon County) and more on the social and spiritual degradation that accompanied legal segregation. This case cut to the basic question of whether ‚Äúseparate‚Äù was itself inherently unequal. The NAACP said the two notions were incompatible. As one witness before the U.S. District Court of Kansas said, ‚ÄúThe entire colored race is craving light, and the only way to reach the light is to start [black and white] children together in their infancy and they come up together.‚Äù (<span title="Patterson and Freehling, Brown v. Board, xxv.">x</span>)</p>
		<p>To make its case, the NAACP marshaled historical and social scientific evidence. The Court found the historical evidence inconclusive and drew their ruling more heavily from the NAACP‚Äôs argument that segregation psychologically damaged Black children. To make this argument, association lawyers relied on social scientific evidence, such as the famous doll experiments of Kenneth and Mamie Clark. The Clarks demonstrated that while young white girls would naturally choose to play with white dolls, young Black girls would, too. The Clarks argued that Black children‚Äôs aesthetic and moral preference for white dolls demonstrated the pernicious effects and self-loathing produced by segregation.</p>
		<p>Identifying and denouncing injustice, though, is different from rectifying it. Though <em>Brown</em> repudiated <em>Plessy</em>, the Court‚Äôs orders did not extend to segregation in places other than public schools and, even then, to preserve a unanimous decision for such an historically important case, the justices set aside the divisive yet essential question of enforcement. Their infamously ambiguous order in 1955 (what came to be known as <em>Brown II</em>) that school districts desegregate ‚Äúwith all deliberate speed‚Äù was so vague and ineffectual that it left the actual business of desegregation in the hands of those who opposed it.</p>

<div class="section">
    <div class="text-content default" data-level="level1">
        <p>In many places in the South and the rest of America, schools didn't really start mixing students of different races until long after the <em>Brown</em> decision. It wasn't until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that the government began to really push for this change. They told school districts that if they didn't start integrating, they might lose money from the government. Even with this threat, some schools in the South still tried to avoid mixing their students. However, court cases like <em>Green v. New Kent County</em> in 1968 and <em>Alexander v. Holmes</em> in 1969 stopped some of these ways schools were trying to keep students separated, like the ‚Äúfreedom of choice‚Äù plans, and started to make real changes in integration.</p>
		<p>Once the <em>Brown</em> decision began to be enforced in the South, things changed a lot. Fourteen years after <em>Brown</em>, in 1968, 80% of Black students in the South went to schools that were almost entirely made up of nonwhite students. But by 1972, only 25% of Black students were in those kinds of schools, and 55% were in schools where nonwhite students were in the minority. Surprisingly, this made the Southern public schools some of the most integrated in the country.</p>
		<p>The <em>Brown</em> decision is a very important part of American history, not so much because of the immediate changes, which were slow and complicated, but because of what it stood for and the movement it started. The highest court in the country challenged a big part of the laws that kept races separated and helped pave the way for one of the biggest social movements in American history.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-content" data-level="level2">
        <p>In most of the South, as well as the rest of the country, school integration did not occur on a wide scale until well after <em>Brown</em>. Only in the 1964 Civil Rights Act did the federal government finally implement some enforcement of the <em>Brown</em> decision by threatening to withhold funding from recalcitrant school districts, but even then southern districts found loopholes. Court decisions such as <em>Green v. New Kent County</em> (1968) and <em>Alexander v. Holmes</em> (1969) finally closed some of those loopholes, such as ‚Äúfreedom of choice‚Äù plans, to compel some measure of actual integration.</p>
		<p>When <em>Brown</em> finally was enforced in the South, the quantitative impact was staggering. In 1968, fourteen years after <em>Brown</em>, some 80 percent of school-age Black southerners remained in schools that were 90 to 100 percent nonwhite. By 1972, though, just 25 percent were in such schools, and 55 percent remained in schools with a simple nonwhite minority. By many measures, the public schools of the South became, ironically, the most integrated in the nation. (<span title="Charles T. Clotfelter, After Brown: The Rise and Retreat of School Desegregation (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2011), 6.">x</span>)
		<p>As a landmark moment in American history, <em>Brown</em>‚Äôs significance perhaps lies less in immediate tangible changes ‚Äî which were slow, partial, and inseparable from a much longer chain of events ‚Äî than in the idealism it expressed and the momentum it created. The nation‚Äôs highest court had attacked one of the fundamental supports of Jim Crow segregation and offered constitutional cover for the creation of one of the greatest social movements in American history.</p>

<h2 id="sec-2">The Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s</h2>

<div class="section">
    <div class="text-content default" data-level="level1">
        <p>Fighting against racism wasn't just about changing schools. African Americans challenged unfair treatment in all parts of life. Before World War II, these efforts didn't see much success. But, the war effort and a campaign called Double V, which stood for victories against fascism overseas and racism at home, along with the economic growth after the war, made many African Americans hope for better treatment. When racism continued to block their chances for a better life, they started fighting harder against unfair laws and beliefs.</p>
		<p>While we often remember the 1960s for big civil rights events like sit-ins and the March on Washington, the 1950s were also crucial. For example, before Rosa Parks's famous bus protest, Sarah Keys, an African American woman in the army, refused to give up her seat on a bus in 1953. This led to a major decision in 1955 that said "separate but equal" on buses went against the U.S. Constitution. Although this rule wasn't always followed, it helped set the stage for later protests.</p>
		<p>However, not all events were inspiring. In 1955, the murder of a young boy named Emmett Till in Mississippi shocked many. Emmett, from Chicago, didn't follow the racist rules of the South and was killed for it. His killers were found not guilty, but later bragged about their crime. This tragedy motivated many young people to join the civil rights movement.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-content" data-level="level2">
        <p>Education was but one aspect of the nation‚Äôs Jim Crow machinery. African Americans had been fighting against a variety of racist policies, cultures, and beliefs in all aspects of American life. And while the struggle for Black inclusion had few victories before World War II, the war and the Double V campaign for victory against fascism abroad and racism at home, as well as the postwar economic boom led, to rising expectations for many African Americans. When persistent racism and racial segregation undercut the promise of economic and social mobility, African Americans began mobilizing on an unprecedented scale against the various discriminatory social and legal structures.</p>
		<p>While many of the civil rights movement‚Äôs most memorable and important moments, such as the sit-ins, the Freedom Rides, and especially the March on Washington, occurred in the 1960s, the 1950s were a significant decade in the sometimes tragic, sometimes triumphant march of civil rights in the United States. In 1953, years before Rosa Parks‚Äôs iconic confrontation on a Montgomery city bus, an African American woman named Sarah Keys publicly challenged segregated public transportation. Keys, then serving in the Women‚Äôs Army Corps, traveled from her army base in New Jersey back to North Carolina to visit her family. When the bus stopped in North Carolina, the driver asked her to give up her seat for a white customer. Her refusal to do so landed her in jail in 1953 and led to a landmark 1955 decision, <em>Sarah Keys v. Carolina Coach Company</em>, in which the Interstate Commerce Commission ruled that ‚Äúseparate but equal‚Äù violated the Interstate Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Poorly enforced, it nevertheless gave legal coverage for the Freedom Riders years later and motivated further assaults against Jim Crow.</p>
		<p>But if some events encouraged civil rights workers with the promise of progress, others were so savage they convinced activists that they could do nothing but resist. In the summer of 1955, two white men in Mississippi kidnapped and brutally murdered fourteen-year-old Emmett Till. Till, visiting from Chicago and perhaps unfamiliar with the ‚Äúetiquette‚Äù of Jim Crow, allegedly whistled at a white woman named Carolyn Bryant. Her husband, Roy Bryant, and another man, J. W. Milam, abducted Till from his relatives‚Äô home, beat him, mutilated him, shot him, and threw his body in the Tallahatchie River. Emmett‚Äôs mother held an open-casket funeral so that Till‚Äôs disfigured body could make national news. The men were brought to trial. The evidence was damning, but an all-white jury found the two not guilty. Mere months after the decision, the two boasted of their crime, in all of its brutal detail, in <em>Look</em> magazine. ‚ÄúThey ain‚Äôt gonna go to school with my kids,‚Äù Milam said. They wanted ‚Äúto make an example of [Till]‚Äîjust so everybody can know how me and my folks stand.‚Äù (<span title="William Bradford Huie, ‚ÄúThe Shocking Story of Approved Killing in Mississippi,‚Äù Look (January 24, 1956), 46‚Äì50.">x</span>) The Till case became an indelible memory for the young Black men and women soon to propel the civil rights movement forward.</p>

        <p>In December 1955, Rosa Parks's refusal to give up her seat led to the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Activists, including Martin Luther King Jr., organized this boycott, which lasted over a year and ended with the Supreme Court ordering buses to be integrated. This victory was a big boost for the civil rights movement.</p>
		<p>Encouraged by Montgomery's success, Martin Luther King Jr. and others founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in 1957 to help organize protests across the South. That same year, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the first such law since Reconstruction. Though it wasn't very strong, it showed that the fight for civil rights was starting to have an impact.</p>
		<p>Despite these wins, the civil rights movement faced strong opposition. People against the movement often used violence to scare and stop African Americans from demanding their rights. For instance, during the Montgomery boycott, some churches and civil rights leaders' homes were bombed. This violence showed the tough challenges the movement still had to overcome.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-content" data-level="level2">
        <p>On December 1, 1955, four months after Till‚Äôs death and six days after the <em>Keys v. Carolina Coach Company</em> decision, Rosa Parks refused to surrender her seat on a Montgomery city bus and was arrested. Montgomery‚Äôs public transportation system had longstanding rules requiring African American passengers to sit in the back of the bus and to give up their seats to white passengers if the buses filled. Parks was not the first to protest the policy by staying seated, but she was the first around whom Montgomery activists rallied.</p>
		<p>Activists sprang into action. Joanne Robinson, who as head of the Women‚Äôs Political Council had long fought against the city‚Äôs segregated busing, worked long into the night to with a colleague and two students from Alabama State College to mimeograph over 50,000 handbills calling for an immediate boycott. Montgomery‚Äôs Black community responded, and, in response, local ministers and civil rights workers formed the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) to coordinate an organized, sustained boycott of the city‚Äôs buses. The Montgomery Bus Boycott lasted from December 1955 until December 20, 1956, when the Supreme Court ordered their integration. The boycott not only crushed segregation in Montgomery‚Äôs public transportation, it energized the entire civil rights movement and established the leadership of the MIA‚Äôs president, a recently arrived, twenty-six-year-old Baptist minister named Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
		<p>Motivated by the success of the Montgomery boycott, King and other Black leaders looked to continue the fight. In 1957, King, fellow ministers such as Ralph Abernathy and Fred Shuttlesworth, and key staffers such as Ella Baker and Septima Clark helped create and run the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to coordinate civil rights groups across the South in their efforts to organize and sustain boycotts, protests, and other assaults against Jim Crow discrimination.</p>
		<p>As pressure built, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the first such measure passed since Reconstruction. The act was compromised away nearly to nothing, although it did achieve some gains, such as creating the Department of Justice‚Äôs Civil Rights Commission, which was charged with investigating claims of racial discrimination. And yet, despite its weakness, the act signaled that pressure was finally mounting on Americans to confront the legacy of discrimination.</p>
		<p>Despite successes at both the local and national level, the civil rights movement faced bitter opposition. Those opposed to the movement often used violent tactics to scare and intimidate African Americans and subvert legal rulings and court orders. For example, a year into the Montgomery bus boycott, angry white southerners bombed four African American churches as well as the homes of King and fellow civil rights leader E. D. Nixon. Though King, Nixon, and the MIA persevered in the face of such violence, it was only a taste of things to come. Such unremitting hostility and violence left the outcome of the burgeoning civil rights movement in doubt. Despite its successes, civil rights activists looked back on the 1950s as a decade of mixed results and incomplete accomplishments. While the bus boycott, Supreme Court rulings, and other civil rights activities signaled progress, church bombings, death threats, and stubborn legislators demonstrated the distance that still needed to be traveled.</p>

<h2 id="sec-3">the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s</h2>

<div class="section">
    <div class="text-content default" data-level="level1">
        <p>So much of what defined the sixties came from the civil rights movement, which saw its biggest wins early in the decade. The people leading the charge for change were evolving. The activists of the 1950s, often middle-class and not young, were joined by students in the 1960s who demanded faster progress against segregation in the South. Their approach included direct protests like marches, boycotts, and sit-ins.</p>
		<p>The civil rights movement really started to shift in 1960 at a North Carolina department store. Four African American students sat at a lunch counter meant only for white people, refusing to leave without service. They faced ridicule, attacks, and arrest, but their sit-in at Greensboro led to desegregating Woolworth's stores and inspired similar actions across the South. This showed that student-led protests could make a difference. Disappointed with the distant, professional civil rights leadership, Ella Baker left Martin Luther King Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference to start the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), which took a more direct, confrontational approach to civil rights.</p>
		<p>In 1961, civil rights supporters tried a new tactic with the Freedom Rides, organized by the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) to challenge segregation on public buses and trains, despite a Supreme Court decision against it. The Freedom Riders faced violent resistance, especially in Alabama, but their efforts led to the enforcement of integrated interstate buses and trains by the end of the year.</p>
		<p>That fall, activists targeted Albany, Georgia, for its deep-seated segregation. They formed the Albany Movement, which faced a unique challenge from the police chief who avoided using violence and instead made mass arrests. This was a learning moment for civil rights activists.</p>
		<p>The Albany Movement also highlighted the role of Black Christianity in the civil rights fight, asserting that all people are equal in God's eyes and that discrimination is wrong. This religious aspect motivated many activists and framed segregation as not just unfair, but morally wrong.</p>
		<p>As the civil rights movement grew, so did white resistance. In 1962, James Meredith's enrollment at the University of Mississippi led to violent riots, showing the deep-seated opposition to desegregation in education. This event, known as the Battle of Ole Miss, ended with troops being called in to restore order, underlining the challenges the movement faced.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-content" data-level="level2">
        <p>So much of the energy and character of the sixties emerged from the civil rights movement, which won its greatest victories in the early years of the decade. The movement itself was changing. Many of the civil rights activists pushing for school desegregation in the 1950s were middle-class and middle-aged. In the 1960s, a new student movement arose whose members wanted swifter changes in the segregated South. Confrontational protests, marches, boycotts, and sit-ins accelerated.(<span title="For the major events of the civil rights movement, see Taylor Branch, Parting the Waters: America in the King Years, 1954‚Äì63 (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1988); Taylor Branch, Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years, 1963‚Äì65 (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1998); and Taylor Branch, At Canaan‚Äôs Edge: America in the King Years, 1965‚Äì68 (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2007).">x</span>)
		<p>The tone of the modern U.S. civil rights movement changed at a North Carolina department store in 1960, when four African American students participated in a sit-in at a whites-only lunch counter. The 1960 Greensboro sit-ins were typical. Activists sat at segregated lunch counters in an act of defiance, refusing to leave until being served and willing to be ridiculed, attacked, and arrested if they were not. This tactic drew resistance but forced the desegregation of Woolworth‚Äôs department stores. It prompted copycat demonstrations across the South. The protests offered evidence that student-led direct action could enact social change. Increasingly disenchanted with the seemingly distant, professionalized civil rights leadership of older southern ministers, Ella Baker left King‚Äôs Southern Christian Leadership Conference and helped organize the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC, and often pronounced ‚Äúsnick‚Äù) that year. She embraced the direct, grassroots action of student activists such as Julian Bond, Stokely Carmichael, Diane Nash, John Lewis, and countless other who would push the civil rights movement in a new, more confrontational direction.(<span title="Branch, Parting the Waters.">x</span>)
		<p>In the following year, 1961, civil rights advocates attempted a bolder variation of a sit-in when they participated in the Freedom Rides. Activists in the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) organized interstate bus rides following a Supreme Court decision outlawing segregation on public buses and trains. The rides intended to test the court‚Äôs ruling, which many southern states had ignored. An interracial group of Freedom Riders boarded buses in Washington, D.C., with the intention of sitting in integrated patterns on the buses as they traveled through the Deep South. On the initial rides in May 1961, the riders encountered fierce resistance in Alabama. Angry mobs composed of KKK members attacked riders in Birmingham, burning one of the buses and beating the activists who escaped. Additional Freedom Rides launched through the summer and generated national attention amid additional violent resistance. Ultimately, the Interstate Commerce Commission enforced integrated interstate buses and trains in November 1961.(<span title="Raymond Arsenault, Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006).">x</span>)
		<p>In the fall of 1961, civil rights activists descended on Albany, a small city in southwest Georgia. Known for entrenched segregation and racial violence, Albany seemed an unlikely place for Black Americans to rally and demand change. The activists there, however, formed the Albany Movement, a coalition of civil rights organizers that included members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and the NAACP. But the movement was stymied by Albany police chief Laurie Pritchett, who launched mass arrests but refused to engage in police brutality and bailed out leading officials to avoid negative media attention. It was a peculiar scene, and a lesson for southern activists. (<span  title="Clayborne Carson, In Struggle: SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1980); Adam Fairclough, To Redeem the Soul of America: The Southern Christian Leadership Conference &amp; Martin Luther King (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1987).">x</span>)
		<p>The Albany Movement included elements of a Christian commitment to social justice in its platform, with activists stating that all people were ‚Äúof equal worth‚Äù in God‚Äôs family and that ‚Äúno man may discriminate against or exploit another.‚Äù In many instances in the 1960s, Black Christianity propelled civil rights advocates to action and demonstrated the significance of religion to the broader civil rights movement. King‚Äôs rise to prominence underscored the role that African American religious figures played in the 1960s civil rights movement. Protesters sang hymns and spirituals as they marched. Preachers rallied the people with messages of justice and hope. Churches hosted meetings, prayer vigils, and conferences on nonviolent resistance. The moral thrust of the movement strengthened African American activists and confronted white society by framing segregation as a moral evil.(<span title="David L. Chappell, A Stone of Hope: Prophetic Religion and the Death of Jim Crow (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2005).">x</span>)
		<p>As the civil rights movement garnered more followers and more attention, white resistance stiffened. In October 1962, James Meredith became the first African American student to enroll at the University of Mississippi. Meredith‚Äôs enrollment sparked riots on the Oxford campus, prompting President John F. Kennedy to send in U.S. Marshals and National Guardsmen to maintain order. On an evening known infamously as the Battle of Ole Miss, segregationists clashed with troops in the middle of campus, resulting in two deaths and hundreds of injuries. Violence served as a reminder of the strength of white resistance to the civil rights movement, particularly in the realm of education.(<span title="Branch, Parting the Waters.">x</span>)

        <p>The year 1963 stands out as a key moment for civil rights, with the Birmingham Campaign led by the SCLC as a highlight. This wide effort aimed to end segregation in Birmingham, Alabama, using methods like business boycotts, sit-ins, and peaceful marches. Martin Luther King Jr., a leader of the SCLC, was arrested, leading to his famous letter advocating for nonviolent but direct action against injustice. The campaign not only boosted King's national image but also showed the harsh reality of segregation through images of police using force on protesters. It achieved a win by securing an agreement to desegregate public places in Birmingham, earning worldwide respect for the nonviolent strategy despite facing violence and bombings.</p>
		<p>As the civil rights movement gained momentum, opposition from white conservatives grew. George Wallace, known for his strong pro-segregation stance, became a symbol of this resistance with his infamous commitment to "segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever!" during his 1963 inauguration as Alabama governor. Wallace's defiance made him a key figure representing the challenges faced by civil rights activists from those who wanted to maintain the status quo.</p>
		<p>Wallace's support for segregation gained national attention, especially during his "Stand in the Schoolhouse Door" protest against the integration of the University of Alabama. This act prompted President Kennedy to call for a comprehensive civil rights bill, but the effort faced delays in Congress. The assassination of civil rights leader Medgar Evers in Mississippi soon after highlighted the dangers of advocating for change.</p>
		<p>The March on Washington in August 1963 was a pivotal event, demanding various civil rights measures and economic improvements. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech at this march became an iconic moment, intensifying pressure on politicians to enact civil rights laws.</p>
		<p>President Kennedy showed support for civil rights legislation, but faced strong opposition from southern lawmakers and was hesitant to push too hard for it. After his assassination in November 1963, Vice President Lyndon Johnson took over. Despite not having Kennedy's charm, Johnson used his deep political experience to push through the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a landmark law that ended segregation in public places and prohibited discrimination.</p>
		<p>The civil rights movement's persistence enabled political leaders to pass significant legislation, and activism continued, including the Freedom Summer in Mississippi in 1964 aimed at registering African American voters. This period saw significant progress but also violent opposition, highlighted by the murders of three CORE activists in Mississippi. The creation of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and its challenge at the Democratic National Convention underscored ongoing struggles for equality.</p>
		<p>In 1965, the Selma to Montgomery marches highlighted the fight for voting rights, with the first attempt known as "Bloody Sunday" due to the violent response from law enforcement. These efforts led to the introduction and eventual passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, marking another victory against legal segregation and voting discrimination.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-content" data-level="level2">
        <p>The following year, 1963, was perhaps the decade‚Äôs most eventful year for civil rights. In April and May, the SCLC organized the Birmingham Campaign, a broad campaign of direct action aiming to topple segregation in Alabama‚Äôs largest city. Activists used business boycotts, sit-ins, and peaceful marches as part of the campaign. SCLC leader Martin Luther King Jr. was jailed, prompting his famous handwritten letter urging not only his nonviolent approach but active confrontation to directly challenge injustice. The campaign further added to King‚Äôs national reputation and featured powerful photographs and video footage of white police officers using fire hoses and attack dogs on young African American protesters. It also yielded an agreement to desegregate public accommodations in the city: activists in Birmingham scored a victory for civil rights and drew international praise for the nonviolent approach in the face of police-sanctioned violence and bombings. (<span title="Ibid.">x</span>) 
		<p>White resistance intensified. While much of the rhetoric surrounding the 1960s focused on a younger, more liberal generation‚Äôs progressive ideas, conservatism maintained a strong presence on the American political scene. Few political figures in the decade embodied the working-class, conservative views held by millions of white Americans quite like George Wallace. Wallace‚Äôs vocal stance on segregation was immortalized in his 1963 inaugural address as Alabama governor with the phrase: ‚ÄúSegregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever!‚Äù Just as the civil rights movement began to gain unprecedented strength, Wallace became the champion of the many white southerners opposed to the movement. Consequently, Wallace was one of the best examples of the very real opposition civil rights activists faced in the late twentieth century. (<span title="Dan T. Carter, The Politics of Rage: George Wallace, the Origins of the New Conservatism, and the Transformation of American Politics (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 2000).">x</span>) 
		<p>As governor, Wallace loudly supported segregation. His efforts were symbolic, but they earned him national recognition as a political figure willing to fight for what many southerners saw as their traditional way of life. In June 1963, just five months after becoming governor, in his ‚ÄúStand in the Schoolhouse Door,‚Äù Wallace famously stood in the door of Foster Auditorium to protest integration at the University of Alabama. President Kennedy addressed the nation that evening, criticizing Wallace and calling for a comprehensive civil rights bill. A day later, civil rights leader Medgar Evers was assassinated at his home in Jackson, Mississippi.</p>
		<p>That summer, civil rights leaders organized the August 1963 March on Washington. The march called for, among other things, civil rights legislation, school integration, an end to discrimination by public and private employers, job training for the unemployed, and a raise in the minimum wage. On the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, King delivered his famous ‚ÄúI Have a Dream‚Äù speech, an internationally renowned call for civil rights that raised the movement‚Äôs profile to new heights and put unprecedented pressure on politicians to pass meaningful civil rights legislation. (<span title="Branch, Parting the Waters.">x</span>) 
		<p>Kennedy offered support for a civil rights bill, but southern resistance was intense and Kennedy was unwilling to expend much political capital on it. And so the bill stalled in Congress. Then, on November 22, 1963, President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. The nation‚Äôs youthful, popular president was gone. Vice President Lyndon Johnson lacked Kennedy‚Äôs youth, his charisma, his popularity, and his aristocratic upbringing, but no one knew Washington better and no one before or since fought harder and more successfully to pass meaningful civil rights legislation. Raised in poverty in the Texas Hill Country, Johnson scratched and clawed his way up the political ladder. He was both ruthlessly ambitious and keenly conscious of poverty and injustice. He idolized Franklin Roosevelt whose New Deal had brought improvements for the impoverished central Texans Johnson grew up with.</p>
		<p>President Lyndon Johnson, then, an old white southerner with a thick Texas drawl, embraced the civil rights movement. He took Kennedy‚Äôs stalled civil rights bill, ensured that it would have teeth, and navigated it through Congress. The following summer he signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, widely considered to be among the most important pieces of civil rights legislation in American history. The comprehensive act barred segregation in public accommodations and outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, and national or religious origin.</p>
		<p>The civil rights movement created space for political leaders to pass legislation, and the movement continued pushing forward. Direct action continued through the summer of 1964, as student-run organizations like SNCC and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) helped with the Freedom Summer in Mississippi, a drive to register African American voters in a state with an ugly history of discrimination. Freedom Summer campaigners set up schools for African American children. Even with progress, intimidation and violent resistance against civil rights continued, particularly in regions with longstanding traditions of segregation. Three young CORE activists, James Chaney, Michael Schwerner, and Andrew Goodman, were murdered by local law enforcement officers and Klan members in Neshoba County, outside of Philadelphia, Mississippi. (<span title="Branch, Pillar of Fire.">x</span>) In August, over 2,000 Black Mississippians assembled in Jackson and formed the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. They demanded that their delegates be seated at the Democratic National Convention. Denied anything more than two at-large seats, the Party protested. ‚ÄúI question America,‚Äù co-founder Fannie Lou Hamer said in a nationally televised address. ‚ÄúIs this America?‚Äù she asked.</p>
		<p>Activists kept fighting. In March 1965, activists attempted to march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, on behalf of local African American voting rights. In a narrative that had become familiar, ‚ÄúBloody Sunday‚Äù featured peaceful protesters attacked by white law enforcement with batons and tear gas. After they were turned away violently a second time, marchers finally made the fifty-mile trek to the state capitol later in the month. Coverage of the first march prompted President Johnson to present the bill that became the Voting Rights Act of 1965, an act that abolished voting discrimination in federal, state, and local elections. In two consecutive years, landmark pieces of legislation had assaulted de jure (by law) segregation and disenfranchisement. (<span title="Branch, At Canaan‚Äôs Edge.">x</span>)

<h2 id="letter-1">1404: Letter from Birmingham Jail, pt. 1</h2>

<p>While confined here in the Birmingham city jail, I came across <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181229055408/https://moodle.tiu.edu/pluginfile.php/57183/mod_resource/content/1/StatementAndResponseKingBirmingham1.pdf">your recent statement</a> calling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_campaign" title="a series of marches and sit-ins declared illegal by local laws">my present activities</a> ‚Äúunwise and untimely.‚Äù ...[S]ince I feel that you are men of genuine good will and that your criticisms are sincerely set forth, I want to try to answer your statement in what I hope will be patient and reasonable terms. </p>

<p>I think I should indicate why I am here in Birmingham, since you have been influenced by the view which argues against ‚Äú<a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/09/873592665/unmasking-the-outside-agitator" title="throughout American history it was common to ascribe protests to 'outside agitators', especially real or imagined communists">outsiders coming in</a>.‚Äù I have the honor of serving as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization operating in every southern state, with headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. We have some eighty five affiliated organizations across the South, and one of them is the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. Frequently we share staff, educational and financial resources with our affiliates. Several months ago the affiliate here in Birmingham asked us to be on call to engage in a <span title="King here is heavily influenced by Mahatma Gandhi's idea of 'nonviolent noncooperation,' which was used to peacefully end colonialism in India">nonviolent direct action</span> program if such were deemed necessary. We readily consented, and when the hour came we lived up to our promise. So I, along with several members of my staff, am here because I was invited here.  I am here because I have organizational ties here. </p>

<p>But more basically, I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the <span title="in the Christian and Jewish Bible, most of the verses criticizing governments and the rich for oppressing the weak and poor can be found in the 'prophetic books'; the African-American churches found these books significant for obvious reasons">prophets of the eighth century B.C.</span title> left their villages and carried their ‚Äúthus saith the Lord‚Äù far beyond the boundaries of their home towns, and just as the Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my own home town. Like Paul, I must constantly respond to the <span title="i.e., a place far from Macedon - King is saying here that Saint Paul, who both he and the other ministers he's responding to revere, could be called an 'outside agitator'">Macedonian</span> call for aid. </p>

<p>Moreover, I am <span title="aware">cognizant</span> of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial ‚Äúoutside agitator‚Äù idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds. </p>

<p>You deplore the demonstrations taking place in Birmingham. But your statement, I am sorry to say, fails to express a similar concern for the conditions that brought about the demonstrations. I am sure that none of you would want to rest content with the superficial kind of social analysis that deals merely with effects and does not grapple with underlying causes. It is unfortunate that demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham, but it is even more unfortunate that the city‚Äôs white power structure left the <span title="this term would not have been considered offensive at the time">Negro</span> community with no alternative.  </p>

<p>In any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps: collection of the facts to determine whether injustices exist; negotiation; self purification; and direct action. We have gone through all these steps in Birmingham. There can be no gainsaying the fact that racial injustice engulfs this community. Birmingham is probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States. Its ugly record of brutality is widely known. Negroes have experienced grossly unjust treatment in the courts. There have been more unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches in Birmingham than in any other city in the nation. These are the hard, brutal facts of the case. On the basis of these conditions, Negro leaders sought to negotiate with the city fathers. But the latter consistently refused to engage in good faith negotiation. </p>

<p>Then, last September, came the opportunity to talk with leaders of Birmingham‚Äôs economic community. In the course of the negotiations, certain promises were made by the merchants‚Äîfor example, to remove the stores‚Äô humiliating racial signs. On the basis of these promises, the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth and the leaders of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights agreed to a <span title="pause">moratorium</a> on all demonstrations. As the weeks and months went by, we realized that we were the victims of a broken promise. A few signs, briefly removed, returned; the others remained.</p>

<p>As in so many past experiences, our hopes had been blasted, and the shadow of deep disappointment settled upon us. We had no alternative except to prepare for direct action, whereby we would present our very bodies as a means of laying our case before the conscience of the local and the national community. Mindful of the difficulties involved, we decided to undertake a process of self purification. We began a <a href="https://time.com/3638319/life-and-civil-rights-anatomy-of-a-protest-virginia-1960/">series of workshops on nonviolence</a>, and we repeatedly asked ourselves: ‚ÄúAre you able to accept blows without retaliating?‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you able to endure the ordeal of jail?‚Äù We decided to schedule our direct action program for the Easter season, realizing that except for Christmas, this is the main shopping period of the year. Knowing that a strong economic-withdrawal program would be the by product of direct action, we felt that this would be the best time to bring pressure to bear on the merchants for the needed change. </p>

<p>Then it occurred to us that Birmingham‚Äôs mayoral election was coming up in March, and we speedily decided to <span title="delay">postpone</span> action until after election day. When we discovered that the Commissioner of Public Safety, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_Connor" title="a particularly vicious white supremacist">Eugene ‚ÄúBull‚Äù Connor</a>, had piled up enough votes to be in the <span title="when there is an election and nobody gets a majority, sometimes there is a 'run-off election' between the top two vote getters - depends on the local rules">run off</span>, we decided again to postpone action until the day after the run off so that the demonstrations could not be used to cloud the issues. Like many others, we waited to see Mr. Connor defeated, and to this end we endured postponement after postponement. Having aided in this community need, we felt that our direct action program could be delayed no longer. </p>

<p>You may well ask: ‚ÄúWhy direct action? Why sit ins, marches and so forth? Isn‚Äôt negotiation a better path?‚Äù You are quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and <span title="bring about, help develop">foster</span> such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ‚Äútension.‚Äù I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as <span title="a philosopher in ancient Greece who would challenge people on the street to explain their ideas and note where they contradict themselves - they eventually killed him">Socrates</span> felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half truths to the <span title="free">unfettered</span> realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need for nonviolent <span title="someone who's annoying, but in a useful way, drawing their attention to what they want to ignore - Socrates called himself this after a fly that bites">gadflies</span> to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood. </p>

<p>The purpose of our direct action program is to create a situation so crisis packed that it will <span title="certainly, without fail">inevitably</span> open the door to negotiation. I therefore <span title="agree">concur</span> with you in your call for negotiation. Too long has our beloved Southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue rather than dialogue.</p>

<p>One of the basic points in your statement is that the action that I and my associates have taken in Birmingham is untimely. Some have asked: ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you give the new city administration time to act?‚Äù The only answer that I can give to this query is that the new Birmingham administration must be prodded about as much as the outgoing one, before it will act. We are sadly mistaken if we feel that the election of Albert Boutwell as mayor will bring the millennium to Birmingham. While Mr. Boutwell is a much more gentle person than Mr. Connor, they are both segregationists, dedicated to maintenance of the status quo. I have hope that Mr. Boutwell will be reasonable enough to see the futility of massive resistance to desegregation. But he will not see this without pressure from devotees of civil rights. My friends, I must say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure. <span title="sadly">Lamentably</span>, it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as <span title="an influential Christian philosopher in the postwar period">Reinhold Niebuhr</span> has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals. </p>

<h2 id="letter-2">1405: Letter from Birmingham Jail, pt. 2</h2>

<p>We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was ‚Äúwell timed‚Äù in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word ‚ÄúWait!‚Äù It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This ‚ÄúWait‚Äù has almost always meant ‚ÄúNever.‚Äù We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that ‚Äújustice too long delayed is justice denied.‚Äù </p>

<p>We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God given rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jetlike speed toward gaining political independence, but we still creep at horse and buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say, ‚ÄúWait.‚Äù But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six year old daughter why she can‚Äôt go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five year old son who is asking: ‚ÄúDaddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?‚Äù; when you take a cross county drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading ‚Äúwhite‚Äù and ‚Äúcolored‚Äù; when your first name becomes ‚Äúnigger,‚Äù your middle name becomes ‚Äúboy‚Äù (however old you are) and your last name becomes ‚ÄúJohn,‚Äù and your wife and mother are never given the respected title ‚ÄúMrs.‚Äù; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of ‚Äúnobodiness‚Äù‚Äîthen you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience.  </p>

<p>You express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws. This is certainly a legitimate concern. Since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the public schools, at first glance it may seem rather paradoxical for us consciously to break laws. One may well ask: ‚ÄúHow can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?‚Äù The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that ‚Äúan unjust law is no law at all.‚Äù </p>

<p>Now, what is the difference between the two? How does one determine whether a law is just or unjust? A just law is a man made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law. To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas: An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority. Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an ‚ÄúI it‚Äù relationship for an ‚ÄúI thou‚Äù relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things. Hence segregation is not only politically, economically and sociologically unsound, it is morally wrong and sinful. Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation. Is not segregation an existential expression of man‚Äôs tragic separation, his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness? Thus it is that I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court, for it is morally right; and I can urge them to disobey segregation ordinances, for they are morally wrong. </p>

<p>Let us consider a more concrete example of just and unjust laws. An unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority group compels a minority group to obey but does not make binding on itself. This is difference made legal. By the same token, a just law is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow and that it is willing to follow itself. This is sameness made legal. </p>

<p>Let me give another explanation. A law is unjust if it is inflicted on a minority that, as a result of being denied the right to vote, had no part in enacting or devising the law. Who can say that the legislature of Alabama which set up that state‚Äôs segregation laws was democratically elected? Throughout Alabama all sorts of devious methods are used to prevent Negroes from becoming registered voters, and there are some counties in which, even though Negroes constitute a majority of the population, not a single Negro is registered. Can any law enacted under such circumstances be considered democratically structured? </p>

<p>Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. For instance, I have been arrested on a charge of parading without a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong in having an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade. But such an ordinance becomes unjust when it is used to maintain segregation and to deny citizens the First-Amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and protest. </p>

<p>I hope you are able to see the distinction I am trying to point out. In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid segregationist. That would lead to anarchy. One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law. </p>

<p>Of course, there is nothing new about this kind of civil disobedience. It was evidenced sublimely in the refusal of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego to obey the laws of Nebuchadnezzar, on the ground that a higher moral law was at stake. It was practiced superbly by the early Christians, who were willing to face hungry lions and the excruciating pain of chopping blocks rather than submit to certain unjust laws of the Roman Empire. To a degree, academic freedom is a reality today because Socrates practiced civil disobedience. In our own nation, the Boston Tea Party represented a massive act of civil disobedience. </p>

<p>We should never forget that everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was ‚Äúlegal‚Äù and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was ‚Äúillegal.‚Äù It was ‚Äúillegal‚Äù to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler‚Äôs Germany. Even so, I am sure that, had I lived in Germany at the time, I would have aided and comforted my Jewish brothers. If today I lived in a Communist country where certain principles dear to the Christian faith are suppressed, I would openly advocate disobeying that country‚Äôs antireligious laws. </p>

<p>I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro‚Äôs great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen‚Äôs Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ‚Äúorder‚Äù than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ‚ÄúI agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action‚Äù; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man‚Äôs freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ‚Äúmore convenient season.‚Äù Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.  </p>

<p>I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured. </p>

<p>In your statement you assert that our actions, even though peaceful, must be condemned because they precipitate violence. But is this a logical assertion? Isn‚Äôt this like condemning a robbed man because his possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn‚Äôt this like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by the misguided populace in which they made him drink hemlock? Isn‚Äôt this like condemning Jesus because his unique God consciousness and never ceasing devotion to God‚Äôs will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We must come to see that, as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate violence. Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber. </p>

<p>I had also hoped that the white moderate would reject the myth concerning time in relation to the struggle for freedom. I have just received a letter from a white brother in Texas. He writes: ‚ÄúAll Christians know that the colored people will receive equal rights eventually, but it is possible that you are in too great a religious hurry. It has taken Christianity almost two thousand years to accomplish what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to earth.‚Äù Such an attitude stems from a tragic misconception of time, from the strangely irrational notion that there is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actually, time itself is neutral; it can be used either destructively or constructively. More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will. We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people. Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co workers with God, and without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right. Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity. </p>

<p>You speak of our activity in Birmingham as extreme. At first I was rather disappointed that fellow clergymen would see my nonviolent efforts as those of an extremist. I began thinking about the fact that I stand in the middle of two opposing forces in the Negro community. One is a force of complacency, made up in part of Negroes who, as a result of long years of oppression, are so drained of self respect and a sense of ‚Äúsomebodiness‚Äù that they have adjusted to segregation; and in part of a few middle-class Negroes who, because of a degree of academic and economic security and because in some ways they profit by segregation, have become insensitive to the problems of the masses. The other force is one of bitterness and hatred, and it comes perilously close to advocating  violence. It is expressed in the various black nationalist groups that are springing up across the nation, the largest and best known being Elijah Muhammad‚Äôs Muslim movement. Nourished by the Negro‚Äôs frustration over the continued existence of racial discrimination, this movement is made up of people who have lost faith in America, who have absolutely repudiated Christianity, and who have concluded that the white man is an incorrigible ‚Äúdevil.‚Äù </p>

<p>I have tried to stand between these two forces, saying that we need emulate neither the ‚Äúdo nothingism‚Äù of the complacent nor the hatred and despair of the black nationalist. For there is the more excellent way of love and nonviolent protest. I am grateful to God that, through the influence of the Negro church, the way of nonviolence became an integral part of our struggle. </p>

<p>If this philosophy had not emerged, by now many streets of the South would, I am convinced, be flowing with blood. And I am further convinced that if our white brothers dismiss as ‚Äúrabble rousers‚Äù and ‚Äúoutside agitators‚Äù those of us who employ nonviolent direct action, and if they refuse to support our nonviolent efforts, millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and despair, seek solace and security in black nationalist ideologies‚Äîa development that would inevitably lead to a frightening racial nightmare. </p>

<p>Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself, and that is what has happened to the American Negro. Something within has reminded him of his birthright of freedom, and something without has reminded him that it can be gained. Consciously or unconsciously, he has been caught up by the Zeitgeist, and with his black brothers of Africa and his brown and yellow brothers of Asia, South America and the Caribbean, the United States Negro is moving with a sense of great urgency toward the promised land of racial justice. If one recognizes this vital urge that has engulfed the Negro community, one should readily understand why public demonstrations are taking place. The Negro has many pent up resentments and latent frustrations, and he must release them. So let him march; let him make prayer pilgrimages to the city hall; let him go on freedom rides -and try to understand why he must do so. If his repressed emotions are not released in nonviolent ways, they will seek expression through violence; this is not a threat but a fact of history. So I have not said to my people: ‚ÄúGet rid of your discontent.‚Äù Rather, I have tried to say that this normal and healthy discontent can be channeled into the creative outlet of nonviolent direct action. And now this approach is being termed extremist. </p>

<p>But though I was initially disappointed at being categorized as an extremist, as I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a measure of satisfaction from the label. Was not Jesus an extremist for love: ‚ÄúLove your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use  you, and persecute you.‚Äù Was not Amos an extremist for justice: ‚ÄúLet justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing stream.‚Äù Was not Paul an extremist for the Christian gospel: ‚ÄúI bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.‚Äù Was not Martin Luther an extremist: ‚ÄúHere I stand; I cannot do otherwise, so help me God.‚Äù And John Bunyan: ‚ÄúI will stay in jail to the end of my days before I make a butchery of my conscience.‚Äù And Abraham Lincoln: ‚ÄúThis nation cannot survive half slave and half free.‚Äù And Thomas Jefferson: ‚ÄúWe hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal . . .‚Äù So the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice? In that dramatic scene on Calvary‚Äôs hill three men were crucified. We must never forget that all three were crucified for the same crime‚Äîthe crime of extremism. Two were extremists for immorality, and thus fell below their environment. The other, Jesus Christ, was an extremist for love, truth and goodness, and thereby rose above his environment. Perhaps the South, the nation and the world are in dire need of creative extremists. </p>

<p>I had hoped that the white moderate would see this need. Perhaps I was too optimistic; perhaps I expected too much. I suppose I should have realized that few members of the oppressor race can understand the deep groans and passionate yearnings of the oppressed race, and still fewer have the vision to see that injustice must be rooted out by strong, persistent and determined action. I am thankful, however, that some of our white brothers in the South have grasped the meaning of this social revolution and committed themselves to it. They are still all too few in quantity, but they are big in quality. Some -such as Ralph McGill, Lillian Smith, Harry Golden, James McBride Dabbs, Ann Braden and Sarah Patton Boyle‚Äîhave written about our struggle in eloquent and prophetic terms. Others have marched with us down nameless streets of the South. They have languished in filthy, roach infested jails, suffering the abuse and brutality of policemen who view them as ‚Äúdirty nigger-lovers.‚Äù Unlike so many of their moderate brothers and sisters, they have recognized the urgency of the moment and sensed the need for powerful ‚Äúaction‚Äù antidotes to combat the disease of segregation. </p>

<p>Let me take note of my other major disappointment. I have been so greatly disappointed with the white church and its leadership. Of course, there are some notable exceptions. I am not unmindful of the fact that each of you has taken some significant stands on this issue. I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your Christian stand on this past Sunday, in welcoming Negroes to your worship service on a nonsegregated basis. I commend the Catholic leaders of this state for integrating Spring Hill College several years ago. </p>

<p>But despite these notable exceptions, I must honestly reiterate that I have been disappointed with the church. I do not say this as one of those negative critics who can always find something wrong with the church. I say this as a minister of the gospel, who loves the church; who was nurtured in its bosom; who has been sustained by its spiritual blessings and who will remain true to it as long as the cord of life shall lengthen. </p>

<p>When I was suddenly catapulted into the leadership of the bus protest in Montgomery, Alabama, a few years ago, I felt we would be supported by the white church. I felt that the white ministers, priests and rabbis of the South would be among our strongest allies. Instead, some have been outright opponents, refusing to understand the freedom movement and misrepresenting its leaders; all too many others have been more cautious than courageous and have remained silent behind the anesthetizing security of stained glass windows. </p>

<p>In spite of my shattered dreams, I came to Birmingham with the hope that the white religious leadership of this community would see the justice of our cause and, with deep moral concern, would serve as the channel through which our just grievances could reach the power structure. I had hoped that each of you would understand. But again I have been disappointed. </p>

<p>I have heard numerous southern religious leaders admonish their worshipers to comply with a desegregation decision because it is the law, but I have longed to hear white ministers declare: ‚ÄúFollow this decree because integration is morally right and because the Negro is your brother.‚Äù In the midst of blatant injustices inflicted upon the Negro, I have watched white churchmen stand on the sideline and mouth pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious  trivialities. In the midst of a mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial and economic injustice, I have heard many ministers say: ‚ÄúThose are social issues, with which the gospel has no real concern.‚Äù And I have watched many churches commit themselves to a completely other worldly religion which makes a strange, un-Biblical distinction between body and soul, between the sacred and the secular. </p>

<p>I have traveled the length and breadth of Alabama, Mississippi and all the other southern states. On sweltering summer days and crisp autumn mornings I have looked at the South‚Äôs beautiful churches with their lofty spires pointing heavenward. I have beheld the impressive outlines of her massive religious education buildings. Over and over I have found myself asking: ‚ÄúWhat kind of people worship here? Who is their God? Where were their voices when the lips of Governor Barnett dripped with words of interposition and nullification? Where were they when Governor Wallace gave a clarion call for defiance and hatred? Where were their voices of support when bruised and weary Negro men and women decided to rise from the dark dungeons of complacency to the bright hills of creative protest?‚Äù </p>

<p>Yes, these questions are still in my mind. In deep disappointment I have wept over the laxity of the church. But be assured that my tears have been tears of love. There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love. Yes, I love the church. How could I do otherwise? I am in the rather unique position of being the son, the grandson and the great grandson of preachers. Yes, I see the church as the body of Christ. But, oh! How we have blemished and scarred that body through social neglect and through fear of being nonconformists. </p>

<p>There was a time when the church was very powerful‚Äîin the time when the early Christians rejoiced at being deemed worthy to suffer for what they believed. In those days the church was not merely a thermometer that recorded the ideas and principles of popular opinion; it was a thermostat that transformed the mores of society. Whenever the early Christians entered a town, the people in power became disturbed and immediately sought to convict the Christians for being ‚Äúdisturbers of the peace‚Äù and ‚Äúoutside agitators.‚Äù‚Äô But the Christians pressed on, in the conviction that they were ‚Äúa colony of heaven,‚Äù called to obey God rather than man. Small in number, they were big in commitment. They were too God-intoxicated to be ‚Äúastronomically intimidated.‚Äù By their effort and example they brought an end to such ancient evils as infanticide and gladiatorial contests. </p>

<p>Things are different now. So often the contemporary church is a weak, ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound. So often it is an archdefender of the status quo. Far from being disturbed by the presence of the church, the power structure of the average community is consoled by the church‚Äôs silent‚Äîand often even vocal‚Äîsanction of things as they are. </p>

<p>But the judgment of God is upon the church as never before. If today‚Äôs church does not recapture the sacrificial spirit of the early church, it will lose its authenticity, forfeit the loyalty of millions, and be dismissed as an irrelevant social club with no meaning for the twentieth century. Every day I meet young people whose disappointment with the church has turned into outright disgust. </p>

<p>Perhaps I have once again been too optimistic. Is organized religion too inextricably bound to the status quo to save our nation and the world? Perhaps I must turn my faith to the inner spiritual church, the church within the church, as the true ekklesia and the hope of the world. But again I am thankful to God that some noble souls from the ranks of organized religion have broken loose from the paralyzing chains of conformity and joined us as active partners in the struggle for freedom. They have left their secure congregations and walked the streets of Albany, Georgia, with us. They have gone down the highways of the South on tortuous rides for freedom. Yes, they have gone to jail with us. Some have been dismissed from their churches, have lost the support of their bishops and fellow ministers. But they have acted in the faith that right defeated is stronger than evil triumphant. Their witness has been the spiritual salt that has preserved the true meaning of the gospel in these troubled times. They have carved a tunnel of hope through the dark mountain of disappointment. </p>

<p>I hope the church as a whole will meet the challenge of this decisive hour. But even if the church does not come to the aid of justice, I have no despair about the future. I have no fear about the outcome of our struggle in Birmingham, even if our motives are at present misunderstood. We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham and all over the nation, because the goal of America is freedom. Abused and scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up with America‚Äôs destiny. Before the pilgrims landed at Plymouth, we were here. Before the pen of Jefferson etched the majestic words of the Declaration of Independence across the pages of history, we were here. For more than two centuries our forebears labored in this country without wages; they made cotton king; they built the homes of their masters while suffering gross injustice and shameful humiliation -and yet out of a bottomless vitality they continued to thrive and develop. If the inexpressible cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the opposition we now face will surely fail. We will win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands. </p>

<p>Before closing I feel impelled to mention one other point in your statement that has troubled me profoundly. You warmly commended the Birmingham police force for keeping ‚Äúorder‚Äù and ‚Äúpreventing violence.‚Äù I doubt that you would have so warmly commended the police force if you had seen its dogs sinking their teeth into unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I doubt that you would so quickly commend the policemen if you were to observe their ugly and inhumane treatment of Negroes here in the city jail; if you were to watch them push and curse old Negro women and young Negro girls; if you were to see them slap and kick old Negro men and young boys; if you were to observe them, as they did on two occasions, refuse to give us food because we wanted to sing our grace together. I cannot join you in your praise of the Birmingham police department. </p>

<p>It is true that the police have exercised a degree of discipline in handling the demonstrators. In this sense they have conducted themselves rather ‚Äúnonviolently‚Äù in public. But for what purpose? To preserve the evil system of segregation. Over the past few years I have consistently preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek. I have tried to make clear that it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends. But now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or perhaps even more so, to use moral means to preserve immoral ends. Perhaps Mr. Connor and his policemen have been rather nonviolent in public, as was Chief Pritchett in Albany, Georgia, but they have used the moral means of nonviolence to maintain the immoral end of racial injustice. As T. S. Eliot has said: ‚ÄúThe last temptation is the greatest treason: To do the right deed for the wrong reason.‚Äù </p>

<p>I wish you had commended the Negro sit inners and demonstrators of Birmingham for their sublime courage, their willingness to suffer and their amazing discipline in the midst of great provocation. One day the South will recognize its real heroes. They will be the James Merediths, with the noble sense of purpose that enables them to face jeering and hostile mobs, and with the agonizing loneliness that characterizes the life of the pioneer. They will be old, oppressed, battered Negro women, symbolized in a seventy two year old woman in Montgomery, Alabama, who rose up with a sense of dignity and with her people decided not to ride segregated buses, and who responded with ungrammatical profundity to one who inquired about her weariness: ‚ÄúMy feets is tired, but my soul is at rest.‚Äù They will be the young high school and college students, the young ministers of the gospel and a host of their elders, courageously and nonviolently sitting in at lunch counters and willingly going to jail for conscience‚Äô sake. One day the South will know that when these disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters, they were in reality standing up for what is best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in our Judaeo Christian heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in their formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. </p>

<p>Never before have I written so long a letter. I‚Äôm afraid it is much too long to take your precious time. I can assure you that it would have been much shorter if I had been writing from a comfortable desk, but what else can one do when he is alone in a narrow jail cell, other than write long letters, think long thoughts and pray long prayers? </p>

<p>If I have said anything in this letter that overstates the truth and indicates an unreasonable impatience, I beg you to forgive me. If I have said anything that understates the truth and indicates my having a patience that allows me to settle for anything less than brotherhood, I beg God to forgive me. </p>

<p>I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith. I also hope that circumstances will soon make it possible for me to meet each of you, not as an integrationist or a civil-rights leader but as a fellow clergyman and a Christian brother. Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear drenched communities, and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty. </p>
