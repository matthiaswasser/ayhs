				            <p>After World War II, America faced ongoing issues with racial discrimination, including fights against segregation in schools. Back in 1896, the Supreme Court had ruled that having separate facilities for different races was okay as long as they were equal. But in reality, Black students in the South often had less money spent on their education, went to schools in poor condition, and used low-quality learning materials. African Americans fought against this unfair treatment in education for over fifty years.</p>
					    		<p>Then, on May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court made a big decision in a case called <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>. The Chief Justice, Earl Warren, announced that the court unanimously agreed (9-0) that separating students by race was unconstitutional because it went against the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. They said that having separate schools for different races was naturally unfair. This decision made "separate but equal" illegal.</p>
									<p>The victory in the <em>Brown</em> case came after many years of hard work by African Americans, who fought against racial inequality through lawsuits and protests, and the support of liberal judges on the Supreme Court. Starting in the 1930s, the <abbr title="National Association for the Advancement of Colored People">NAACP</abbr> (a group working for the rights of African Americans) began to attack the laws that allowed segregation in the South. Laws and social norms there were especially tough on Black people. Through many court cases about education, voting rights, and jury service, NAACP lawyers like Charles Hamilton Houston, Robert L. Clark, and Thurgood Marshall, who later became a Supreme Court Justice himself, worked to show that the government was not providing equal opportunities to Black students as promised. By the late 1940s, activists started to argue more strongly against the idea that separation by race was even legal.</p>

											        <p>Older battles over racial exclusion also confronted postwar American society. One long-simmering struggle targeted segregated schooling. In 1896, in <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em>, the Supreme Court declared the principle of ‚Äúseparate but equal‚Äù constitutional. Segregated schooling, however, was rarely ‚Äúequal‚Äù: in practice, Black Americans, particularly in the South, received fewer funds, attended inadequate facilities, and studied with substandard materials. African Americans‚Äô battle against educational inequality stretched across half a century before the Supreme Court again took up the merits of ‚Äúseparate but equal.‚Äù</p>
														<p>On May 17, 1954, after two years of argument, re-argument, and deliberation, Chief Justice Earl Warren announced the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision on segregated schooling in <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> (1954). The court found by a unanimous 9‚Äì0 vote that racial segregation violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court‚Äôs decision declared, ‚ÄúSeparate educational facilities are inherently unequal.‚Äù ‚ÄúSeparate but equal‚Äù was made unconstitutional.(<span title="Oliver Brown, et al. v. Board of Education of Topeka, et al., 347 U.S. 483 (1954).">x</span>)</p>
																<p>Decades of African American‚Äìled <span title="bringing challenges in the court system">litigation</span>, local agitation against racial inequality, and liberal Supreme Court justices made <em>Brown</em> possible. In the early 1930s, the NAACP began a concerted effort to erode the legal underpinnings of segregation in the American South. Legal, or <em>de jure</em>, segregation subjected racial minorities to discriminatory laws and policies. Law and custom in the South hardened antiblack restrictions. But through a series of carefully chosen ACP lawyers such as Charles Hamilton Houston, Robert L. Clark, resources and facilities, and thus failed to live up to <em>Plempt>

Elliott</em>, highlighted the poor conditions of segregated Black schools in a South Carolina county. In 1950, a lot more money was spent on educating white students compared to Black students. The area's white schools were worth a lot more than the numerous Black schools, which were in bad shape and overcrowded. While Briggs showed how the South wasn't meeting the equal part of "separate but equal," the Brown case focused more on how being segregated by law made B>To support their argument, the NAACP used both history and social science. The Supreme Court wasn't convinced by the historical evidence alone but was influenced by the NAACP's proof that segregation hurt Black children mentally. This proof included experiments by Kenneth and Mamie Clark with dolls, showing that both Black and white children preferred white dolls. This preference suggested that segregation made Black children view themsand difficult.</p>

																																																																																					              <p>Though remembered as just one lawsuit, <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> consolidated five separate cases that had originated in the southeastern United States: <em>Briggs v. Elliott</em> (South Carolina), <em>Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County</em> (Virginia), <em>Beulah v. Belton</em> (Delaware), <em>Bolling v. Sharpe</em> (Washington, D.C.), and <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> (Kansas). Working with local activists already involved in desegregation fights, the NAACP purposely chose cases with a diverse set of local backgrounds to show that segregation was not just an issue in the Deep South, and that a sweeping judgment on the fundamental constitutionality of <em>Plessy</em> was needed.</p>
																																																																																						      		<p><em>Briggs v. Elliott</em>, the first case accepted by the NAACP, illustrated the plight of segregated Black schools. <em>Briggs</em> originated in rural Clarendon County, South Caroren together in their infancy and they come up together.‚Äù (<smonstrated that while young white girls would naturally choose to play with white dolls, young Black girls would, too. The Clarks argued that Black children‚Äôs aesthetic and moral preference for white dolls demonstrated the pernicious effects and self-loathing produced by segregation.</p>
																																																																																										<p>Identifying and denouncing injustice, though, is different from rectifying it. Though <em>Brown</em> repudiated <em>Plessy</em>, the Court‚Äôs orders did not extend to segregation in places other than public schools and, even then, to preserve a unanimous decision for such an historically important case, the justices set asng after the <em>Brown</em> decision. It wasn't until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that the government began to really push for this change. They told school districts that if they didn't start integrating, they might lose money from the government. Even with this threat, some schools in the South still tried to avoid mixing their students. However, court cases like <em>Green v. New Kent County</em> in 1968 and <em>Alexander v. Holmes</em> in 1969 stopped some of these ways schools were trying to keep students separated, like the ‚Äúfreedom of choice‚Äù plans, and started to make real changes in integratiountil well after <em>Brown</em>. Only in the 1964 Civil Rights Act did the federal government finally implement some enforcement of the <em>Brown</em> decision by threatening to withhold funding from recalcitrant school districts, but even then southern districts found loopholes. Court decisions such as <em>Green v. New Kent County</em> (1968) and <em>Alexander v. Holmes</em> (1969) finally closed some of those loopholes, such as ‚Äúfreedom of choice‚Äù plans, to compel some measure of actual integration.</p>
																																																																																												<p>When <em>Brown</em> finally was enforced in the South, the quantitative impact was staggering. In 1968, fourteen years after <em>Brown</em>, some 80 percent of school-agivil rights events like sit-ins and the March on Washington, the 1950s were also crucial. For example, before Rosa Parks's famtution. Although this rule wasn't always followed, it helped set the stage for later protests.</p>
																																																																																														<p>However, not all events were inspiring. In 1955, the murder of a young boy named Emmett Till in Mississippi shocked many. Emmett, from Chicago, didn't follow the racist rules of the South and was killed for it. His killers were found not guilty, but later bragged about their crime. This tragedy motivated many young people to join the civil rights movement.</p>

African Americans had been fighting against a variety of racist policies, cultures, and beliefs in all aspects of American life. And while the struggle for Black inclusion had few victories before World War II, the war and the Double V campaign for victory against fascism abroad and racism at home, as well as the postwar economic boom led, to rising expectations for many African Americans.

In the summer of 1955, two white men in Mississippi kidnapped and brutally murdered fourteen-year-old Emmett Till. Till, visiting from Chicago and perhaps unfamiliar with the ‚Äúetiquette‚Äù of Jim Crow, allegedly whistled at a white woman named Carolyn Bryant. Her husband, Roy Bryant, and another man, J. W. Milam, abducted Till from his relatives‚Äô home, beat him, mutilated him, shot him, and threw his body in the Tallahatchie River. Emmett‚Äôs mother held an open-casket funeral so that Till‚Äôs disfigured body could make national news. The men were brought to trial. The evidence was damning, but an all-white jury found the two not guilty. Mere months after the decision, the two boasted of their crctations of a better life caused people to demand more from society"

																																																																																																																		  		<p>Encouraged by Montgomery's success, Martin Luther King Jr. and others founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in 1957 to help organize protests across the South. That same year, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the first such law since Reconstruction. Though it wasn't very strong, it showed that the fight for civil rights was starting to have an impact.</p>
																																																																																																																						<p>Despite these wins, the civil rights movement faced strong opposition. People against the movement often used violence to scare and stop African Americans from demanding their rights. For instance, during the Montgomery boycott, some churches and civil rights leaders' homes were bombed. This violence showed the tough challenges the movement still had to overcome.</p>
